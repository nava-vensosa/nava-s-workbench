# Assorted Notes

- ** Psychagogia in the Tao Teh Ching**
  - All throughout the Tao Teh Ching are elegent symmetries. Much of the sense and argument of the text emerges by contrasts -- hidden **and** manifest, heavy vs. light. This isn't so much binary logic as differentiation. By introducing a parallax, locutors set a stage, establish a contrast, and in doing so draw a basis for imagining a field of difference. however, my question regarding psychagogia in the Tao Teh Ching is: how much of the Tao Teh Ching's prose is effective because it speaks more to our doxa than the truth of the matter -- more to the apparent world than the noumenal --, and how should be concern ourselves with the parts of this question?

- "as ever hidden, we should look at its inner essence: as always manifest, we should look at its outer aspects"
  - Curious about the relation between the hidden and the inner essence. This could be read as "the noumenal withdraws, the apparent voices itself through aspects and difference; both flow from the same source (time/being) and both are called mysteries, and "The Mystery of mysteries is the Door of all essence" could be a way to read "thaumatein"

- N.b. When all the world recognises good as good, this in itself is evil -- there is nothing between heaven and earth that is good or bad, but thinking makes it so, and thinking this way splits what speaks in harmony and only stands as itself when voicing together with its kosmos.

- Remember: "the Sage manages his affairs without ado, And spreads his teaching without talking. He denies nothing to the teeming things. He rears them, but lays no claim to them. He does his work, but sets no store by it. He accomplishes his task, but does not dwell upon it."

- N.b. Weaken the ambitions, toughen the bones
- N.b. Exalting the talented causes rivalrly and contention among the people

- The Tao is fathomless, and like a container (eikos). 
- The Tao is Archaic -- potential origin of noumena? is there any way that actually works...?
- The Tao "blunts all sharp edges"

- The [Heaven-and-Earth] object is generative, yet lacks moralization; the "Sage" attains to heavenliness and groundedness, and as such "treats all his people as straw-dogs"
  - The tie between this and the Bellows is intriguing
- The Bellows: Between Heaven and Earth, an inexhaustible deep; words can't fathom it, "Better look for it within you."
  - Kant & Constellation? there's a figure here I'm unfamiliar with, a strange texture, a foreign shape

- N.b. gossamer!!!
- Mysterious Feminine = Spirit of the Fountain; Doorway of the Spirit-of-the-Fountain/Mysterious Feminine = Root(Heaven-and-Earth)
  - Draw upon the gossamer, which is the lightest touch, and is the Root of firmament itself / is the Geist(wellspring)
