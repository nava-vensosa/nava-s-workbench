ome fall semester at UC Berkeley, my ex snuck me into an intro class where they teach the software Autechre uses to make their otherworldy computer music: Max/MSP. The class was boring, but it carved out a social and temporal space for me to tinker at my mechanisms in the software for the first time. I had wanted to create music technology for years prior-- but for the first time, it was easy as shit. A couple keystrokes and you could build anything you could imagine-- or, you could just chop shit up and listen to it break. Unlikke regular programming, Max/MSP is a visual language. You instantiate objects in dead space,and drag cables between them like you're building the MAGI computer from Evangelion. It makes software tactile, spatial, and dynamic. My wild and half-baked ideas over the years about fourier analyses, experimenting with language deformations, autonomous composition in rhythm & harmony-- it all became possible overnigght. I tried moving to Pure Data, but the speed and aesthetic appeal of Max kept me hooked, until its runtime limitations led me to start designing machines on paper and implementing them in C++ over this last year. It gave me all that good shit-- wonder, obsession, technique, and a new direction to send me on my way. Like a rung on a ladder, it propelled me up, and I often fondly return to it.
