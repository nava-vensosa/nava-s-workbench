- Closure in Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics"
-* Do a SERIOUS DEEP Notetaking read of Understanding Comics, goddamnit... like seriously, write that shit into the Nachsterb Inn Library... write an essay on it, that shit's worth it.
- I'm upset with myself, this class is better than I'm treating it... I'm the one who's not showing up, because I'm not taking it seriously enough. What is this privilege ass bullshit.

- Dimensions of dialogue, Jan Svankmajer 1982
- MUTO by BLU 2008
- Slow ins & Slow outs are important for movement in animation-- we don't move in linear fashion,
  - Consider doing a slow in/slow out with something like a mirror image 5e multi-contour shadow
  - Add keyframes at the start and the end of each organic movement
- Secondary Action - While a character is talking, maybe they're fidgeting with something
- The Cameraman's Revenge? 1912
- Draag meditation, Fantastic Planet, 1973 -- it's a beautiful strange stop motion
- The Street, 1976, Caroline Leaf, done with Sand & Paint- Asparagus 1979 by Suzan Pitt, cutout and hand drawn animation put together
- Grave of the Fireflies used rotoscoping apparently?
- Shooting at 60 fps and slowing it down to 24 fps makes it look more natural-- "slowing it down" is actually speeding it up, in that you duplicate each frame to squeeze it into the 24-30fps
  - 29.97fps apparently has some weird shit going on
- Bottle, by Kirsten Lepore, impressive ass stop motion film; also Kirsten Lepore's "Hey Stranger" based on meeting men in LA
- Foley in stop motion is important
- Neighbors Norman McLaren 1952 -- stop motion; importance of being earnest?; also chairy tale
-* Stop Motion Studio ?
-* Onion Skinning helps you see a shadow of yr last frame which helps with positioning
