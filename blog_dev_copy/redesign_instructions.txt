1. Pages

There's a visual template for all the pages -- they use the same CSS and JS to look the same. All the pages have the stardust dragon image at the top, and the margin at the top and bottom of the page as well as margins on the sides where the stars.js animation takes place. The stars.js animation should be fixed such that the stars are descending, rather than ascending. 

Apart from the visual layout, all the pages will have a generic content layout in the main section. The Page Title at the top of the main section, followed by a horizontal divider, followed by the page's content.

The HTML code for each page should be populated with content hooks rather than <p></p> or <div></div> sections. More on this in section 3.

2. Hubs

There will be different hubs for different types of content. For now, the hubs are: ITP Gallery, Nachsterb Inn, and Critical Clockwerk Shop. 

Each hub's layout inherits from the generic layout, but the content layout for each page will inherit from the structure of it's Hub's content layout. The specifics of these content layouts will be described in section 4. So, all the pages in the ITP Gallery will inherit from the content layouts described by the appropriate ITPG templates, and the pages in the Critical Clockwerk Shop Hub will have their content laid out according to the appropriate CCWS templates.

3. Content

Content hooks are calls to load content from text files, markdown files, images, graphics, youtube videos, etc. Each page's HTML should be very short and very condensed -- just the necessary boiler plate, the calls to load in the visual templates, and the content templates, followed by the hooks in order of the user's choice.

This way, I can write different text files for a page's Subtitle, Synopsis, Main_Paragraph_Part_1, Graphic_1, Main_Paragraph_Part_2, etc. and to edit this content or change out files, I have to edit the file that's being referenced by the content hook -- that way, I don't have to keep editing the HTML.

5. Navigation

The user should be able to navigate the page using Vim Motions -- hjkl, gg/G/number_line+gg, {/}, 0/$... There should be a blinking cursor on the text of the homepage, which tracks along the words on the content page.

There should be buttons at the bottom of each page for "Back to Home", "Back to Parent", and "Back to Top"
