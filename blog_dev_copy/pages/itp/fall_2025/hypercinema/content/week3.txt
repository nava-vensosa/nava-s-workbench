Pippilotti Rist's Ever is Over All '97 -> Beyonce's in Hold Up. Critique and Sound (Description, Analysis...)

Student Presentations:

Jackie & Minami's presentation: you have a little chibi character or something, and can walk around to different rooms in the house. The different rooms have different music playing as well as diagetic sound. The sounds were sourced from home / memories. Comments: You could hear the rooms in the recordings.

Michael, William, and Gerardo: Sound Vacation translates someone's experience which is the norm into something otherworldly... Recording of a dream? Dialog between machines? Mechanical Insects? Put them all together to create "Robot Paradise". How do organic sounds sometimes sound like inorganic things?

Jean-Jules, Yiyu/Julia, and Yuning/Raven: Supermarket Sound Vacation! Organic/Inorganic; how accurately you can actually reimagine moving through a supermarket space just on the sounds... We use our ears so much to navigate the supermarket so often, just hearing those same sounds in a different setting can carry us through a space via imagination!

Ceren, Seungmin, & Valerie: Industrial, rhythmic, anxiety inducing, sounds like wrappers tearing, remix of the subway announcement, rapidly increasing pace of life, finding a rhythm, some kind of a comedown, then crickets, then silence, then an end... definitely felt like how it's felt adjusting to this city.
