          <p>For our "Space Becomes Place" partner submission, Rachel and I decided to take our partner group on a walk. Since Rachel was going to be abroad on the day of our class, and we spoke different languages, we decided to flip the idea of what a space is on its head a little. The space of inquiry in "Lost in Translating" blends physical place-- the Brooklyn Heights Promenate--, digital space-- our reliance on zoom technology, hotspots, and earbuds (each of which introduced their own chaos), and the space of language and gesture.</p>

          <p>For "Lost in Translating" we went for a walk, each describing what we saw in our first languages. Because there was partial overlap in some of our familiarity with each others' languages, each of us could translate one another either partially, entirely, or not at all. Being in different locations-- whether at a distance before, beside, or behind one another, or a country away--, the delay introduced by physical proximity juxtaposed against zoom's latency caused its own degree of chaos too.</p>
