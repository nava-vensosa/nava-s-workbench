Human-Interface Design (HID) Considerations for FIBRIL

The interface design for FIBRIL prioritizes intuitive, embodied interaction over traditional graphical user interfaces. The project challenges conventional notions of computer interaction by eliminating screens and buttons in favor of spatial, tactile, and proximity-based inputs.

Key HID principles implemented:

Embodied Cognition: The interface leverages natural human movement patterns and spatial awareness rather than requiring learned digital literacy skills.

Immediate Feedback: Light responses occur in real-time with minimal latency, creating tight coupling between action and system response.

Multi-sensory Engagement: While primarily visual, the installation incorporates subtle audio cues and haptic feedback through fiber vibrations.

Scalable Complexity: The interface supports both simple individual interactions and complex multi-user collaborative experiences.

Accessibility: The system is designed to be accessible to users with varying physical abilities, with multiple interaction modalities and adjustable sensitivity settings.

The HID approach draws from research in tangible user interfaces, embodied interaction, and ambient computing to create an interface that feels more like interacting with a living system than operating a machine.
