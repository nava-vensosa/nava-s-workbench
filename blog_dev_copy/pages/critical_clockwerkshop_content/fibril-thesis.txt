Thesis Statement: "FIBRIL: Illuminating the Invisible Networks of Human-Computer Symbiosis"

This project thesis explores how fiber-optic installations can serve as material metaphors for the invisible data networks that increasingly mediate human experience. FIBRIL argues that by making data transmission visible through light, we can better understand our relationship with computational systems and develop more empathetic approaches to human-computer interaction.

Central Arguments:

1. Materiality of Data: Digital information is not immaterial but requires physical infrastructure. FIBRIL makes visible the material conditions of data transmission through its fiber-optic networks.

2. Embodied Computing: Traditional computing interfaces alienate users from their bodies. FIBRIL proposes embodied interaction as a path toward more humane computing experiences.

3. Symbiotic Networks: Rather than tools we use, computational systems are environmental conditions we inhabit. FIBRIL explores how we might design for symbiosis rather than control.

4. Aesthetic Resistance: In an era of invisible surveillance and algorithmic control, making computational processes visible through aesthetic means becomes a form of critical resistance.

The project draws theoretical support from new materialist philosophy, media archaeology, and critical design theory while contributing practical insights for the fields of interaction design and media arts.

Ultimately, FIBRIL suggests that the future of human-computer interaction lies not in increasingly seamless integration, but in maintaining critical awareness of our technological entanglements through aesthetic and embodied practices.
