"Helm & Hull" is a speculative navigation project that reimagines maritime wayfinding technologies for post-climate change futures. Drawing from Indigenous navigation knowledge, contemporary climate science, and speculative design, the project creates alternative navigation systems for a world where GPS satellites have failed and traditional landmarks have been transformed by rising seas.

The project centers around a physical installation that combines traditional wayfinding tools—celestial navigation instruments, wind and wave pattern readers, biological indicators—with speculative future technologies that might emerge from different cultural approaches to environmental relationship. Participants learn navigation techniques that prioritize ecological interdependence over technological mastery.

The title references the essential components of any vessel: the helm for steering and the hull for protection. In an uncertain future, the project asks: How do we steer toward justice while protecting what we value? How do we navigate when familiar landmarks disappear? The project suggests that navigation has always been a practice of relationship—with stars, currents, wildlife, and each other—rather than mere technological application.
