The Origins of Aesthetic Thought in Ancient Greece : Matter, Sensation, and Experience - James I. Porter 
---

"... On the methodological plane there is an attitue shared by Merleau-Pontian phenomenology and the epistemology of microphysics, such as it is stated in Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, according to which we cannot radically separate the scientific "object" discovered at the end of research from the path of the thought and the operative processes that have led to revealing and constructing it." - Jacques Garelli, "The Philosophical and Scientific Horizon of The Method" in the foreword of Gilbert Simondon's "Individuation in Light of Notions of Form and Matter"

"Physics doesn't explain anything. It just describes cases of concomitance." - Ludwig Wittgenstein, "Lecture on Aesthetics (1939)"

"to have an aesthetic perception is to have an emperical -- phenomenal, material, sensual -- encounter with that object, the experience of which *can never be shed* subsequently. To think along such lines is to enhance one's view of aesthetic experience; and it is to enlarge the scope of lived experience, thereby enriching it, drawing it out, extending its dimensions."

"Kant's position is that *our fundamental posture towards the world, and the world's posture towards us, is aesthetic." - porter 51

Porter 59 on Timaeus/Phaedrus and harmonia: "Leaving aside the wide resonance, and not jus applicability, of terms like poiesis, techne, or mimesis, which point to the largest roles of art, no matter what the medium, as a form of making, technique, or representation -- or more simply, as a form of production and reproduction -- consider how euschemosune (gracefulness) cuts across various art forms in addition to personal deportment (what we would call habitus): "Fine words, harmony, gracefulness, and rhythm follow goodness of character.' Terms like harmonia (fittingness), poikilia (variety), diathesis or dispositio (arrangement), rhuthmos (rhythm, shape), charis or gratia (charm), megethos or pondus (grandeur or weight), skleros or durus (hard, severe, rough), are commonplaces that run through all the domains of ancient art.
--> contrast with Wittgenstein's content/discontent in aesthetic judgement, 

- Within the hylomorphic schema, the mold informs the matter's becoming...
  - Simondon Notions p. 28 "The fact that there is a mold, i.e. limits of actualization, creates in the matter a state of reciprocity in the forces that lead to equilibrium; the mold does not act from the outside by imposing a form... *The mold translates its existence into the matter by making it tend towards a condition of equilibrium.*" 
    - Interstitial baking-in of the form's retention delimited by harmonia (fittingness)
      - The Ister almost seems to flow backwards

What is going on in the politics of form emerging from the construction and design of a generative instrument? As designers, when we create an instrument, a tool, or anything intended to facilitate or guide the work of an audience, how might we consider the basis by which the form of our creation informs our audience's experience for insights that may improve our designs?

I believe scholarship in aesthetics holds insight for innovative design. My interest in this essay stems from psychagogia -- "leading the mind." The theoretical mode of my inquiry is through aesthetic theory in the scope of dramaturgy and the mind. The practical mode of my investigation is by case study of harmonic machines (Aeolian-Skinner Pipe Organs, Austin Pipe Organs, and a harmonizer of my own design named FIBRIL). The synthesis of these modes is the basis of my argumentation.

Why aesthetics as the mode of theoretical inquiry? James Porter argues "Aesthetics as a term and in its root meanings points us to the sensuous experience of art." Meditation on aesthetics, then, is physical -- basic, immediate --, and also psychological -- culturally indexed. Porter continues to argue that deep inquiry is often limited by our "division of the senses and the labors of form. Art History is equated with visual art; musical history and theory exclude poetry... Aesthetics as a unifying disciplinary marker is rarely invoked." When the approach of our inquiry is siloed into methodical disciplines, our study overlooks the politics of form (as Victoria Wohl puts it) playing out in our engagement with the matter at hand. Ok, fine -- a holistic critique by aesthetics may reveal fundamental insight regarding how the matter of study or expression  and the form it takes in public engagement as well as the broader ripples emerging from the event of engagement which would be lost in a more particular scope or methodological approach... but how are we to carry out such an aesthetically informed inquiry?

Wittgenstein gives a keen insight into aesthetic study: the aesthetics at hand depend on their situated context. The aesthetic judgements a musician has to make in refining their study of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier differ entirely from the judgements a cabinet maker relies on in fashioning, finishing, assembling, and transporting furniture pieces to order. Though both are craftsmen, the language of the musician and the carpenter rarely intersect, for what determines a good rendition of the WTC relies on a fully different system of experience than what determines a good cabinet. From the specific case of a craftsman's aesthetic judgements in the work of their craft, a broader sense of "good" and even an ethical sense of "moral good" arise -- that is to say, judgement is learned after discernment, where judgement appraises while discernment differentiates. Judgement binds or synthesizes, while the prior act of discernment 

My focus on aeshtetics in this essay is not focused on beauty or systems or judgement, but on the mechanics of hylomorphism and psychagogia as can be considered through sense and sensation.

1. I'll have to address the mechanics of form
2. Introduction of Hylomorphic Schema and the Politics of Form
3. Study of the Politics of Form through Tragic Aesthetics & the case for Psychagogia as the object of study
4. Reflection on Hylomorphic Schema's operative psychagogic mechanism within this study; concession to the Ister & Antigone via Harmonia (fittingness)
  - Comes after the brick&mold
5. In Technological Invention, this backtracing is less of an Empedoclean zoogonic rhizomatic return, more of a generative sprawl or opening -- reapportionment, transcendental deduction, and the harmonic machines
6. Case study of the pipe organ as harmonic machine
7. Into FIBRIL


NOT DOING
- Aesthetic Judgement
- Ethics; Beauty; Art

STILL NEED:
- Psychagogia, Encomium of Helen, Euripides, Aristotle & Soul
  - Consider weaving in Schelling on the plastic
- Negative Space of Hylomorphic Schemas' processes
  - Probably also exploration of the proxy/agent, potential energy, Generation in Empedocles to Simondon and into spaces
    - N.b. Vital Individuation & Group Individuation && Zoogony, vs. Metastable Coextension & Concomitant Cosmogony (arranging, order -- material; political, aesthetic in zoogonic -- formal)
      - Coextensive concomitance for poesis; the opening-out instead of herculean return; generation's profligation
      - My reliance on coextension is not only a reframing of superposition, but a reference to concomitance. It's not a tweak of Simondon's work on the photoelectric effect, but instead an attempt to render ontogenesis not as metastable harmonia, but as generation -- not to prove generation over harmonic return, but to see if these are coextensive in the reality of a harmonic machine. For, aisthesis may only occur in an already individuated appropriative event, AND is an act of individuation in and of itself
- N.b. Porter p. 294; Parmenides & Gorgias, then Empedocles & cosmos

- Ludomusicology (game/music logic-study) of Roger Moseley...
  - "As illustrated by Gregory Bateson’s classic example of a playful nip that at once is and is not a bite, play simultaneously enacts and frames its own ontology: it constitutes territory, map, and the means of relating the two.4 When players play, they also play with play. In the terms of Niklas Luhmann’s systems theory, the (meta)communicative strategies of play illustrate how “recursive operative chains bring about a switch from first-order to second-order techniques (and back),” as Bernhard Siegert formulates it. For participants and observers alike, the paradoxical logic of play shuttles between the material and the symbolic as well as between the real and the imaginary, revealing the worlds it creates to coexist with those on which it reflects." page 3
  - "Play’s resistance to definition is one of its defining qualities. Typically negoti-
ating between subject and object, the verb “to play” connotes a relational mode
at the same time as denoting a particular type of ludic action. Even when “the play’s the thing,” which is to say masquerading as a noun, play never stops playing. Correspondingly, music is not merely the outcome of a certain type of play, but constitutes a set of cognitive, technological, and social resources for playing in and with the world through the medium of sound, its mechanisms, and its representations. Play, in turn, becomes the means by which such musical behavior is made audible. In these multiple senses, play activates music via patterns of actions that can be identified as ludomusical. Within (and against) the constraints that regulate it, ludomusical play fluctuates between the preordained and the unfore- seeable, emerging in relation both to the performance of familiar cultural scripts and to the imperative to improvise." page 16
