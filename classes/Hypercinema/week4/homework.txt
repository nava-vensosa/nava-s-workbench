Michael, Jackie and I planned to use cellophane, markers, and my color shifting lamp to do our stop-motion piece. I brought in plastic wrap and the lamp. I put forward the idea of a heart crumpling, and then uncrumpling into two rings, then the reverse image taking place for our stop motion loop.

Homework was also to finish Scott McCloud's Understaning Comics, which I didn't do, and I'm upset about, because I love that book.

N.b. What framerate do we want? Do we want a "virtual" framerate in addition to the actual framerate?

N.b. stop motion foley

N.b. Shooting on ones means every frame is different... do we want to shoot on ones? or would that be worse? Maybe sometimes you want to shoot ones, and other times you want to shoot twos?

N.b. can onion skinning help you?
