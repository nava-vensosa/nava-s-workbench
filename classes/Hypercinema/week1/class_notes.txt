It might by hypoglycemia, but Session 1 of Gabe BC's Hypercinma had me feeling queasy with excitement and the kind of insecurity that hits when you realize you've been doing it wrong. "It", here, is sound art. It's not that I dislike how interleaven with my critical studies the soundworks I make are. Rather, it's that I don't entertain the little life in sounds everywhere like I used to any longer, and that je ne sais jamais jeunesse is lacking in my over-architected sound machines. Gabe's class reminded me how fun it is to have your senses shock you back into your body so creatively yr skin feels new.
