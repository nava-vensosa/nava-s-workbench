- Image Diffusion!
- Flora -- created by an ITP alumn (Webber)! (florafauna.ai) -- node-based ai image combiner
- Different models have been trained on different images, they're trained to different resolutions, they transform a noise mask to the CFG (classifier free guidance) scale of the prompt and then diffuse back by a different algorithm... look at the presentation for this week to transcribe the actual steps, try to get into the mechanism between these steps. 
- hugging face speech processing can graft TTS into a sampled speech input -- IndexTTS2; look into the entire huggingface.co/spaces?category=speech-synthesis page!!! also play with the huggingface image generation pages!
- Rundiffusion.com Automatic1111 WebUI is another site you can use (might not be free... though, there's a computer in the back of ITP that runs Automatic1111 -- Ask Gabe for access!!! this would be wayyyy faster than doing so from your personal computer!!!)
- N.b. might be worthwhile to use ITP computers for the NLP training project

Prompting In Class Activity:
- First Prompt
  - A shark surfing with sunglasses on the moon 
    - Sampling Method: DPM ++ 2M
    - Sampling steps: 4
    - Resolution: 1024x1024
    - CFG Scale: 7
    - Seed: -1 for random; fixed seed to fine tune one image

  - Stepping up to 40 sampling steps gives a much better resolution
  - Providing a negative prompt will pull away from the tokens for those things


- Second Prompt (Individual)
  - 5Ds Stardust Dragon backed by moonlight in the styles of gustav dore and french impressionists
  - Stages:
    - 3 Different Seeds
    - Same Seeds, 3 different Step Values (low, middle, high)
    - 3 different CFG scales per Step Value per Seed
    - 3 different samplers per CFG per Step per Seed
  - Seed 1:
  - Seed 2:
  - Seed 3:
  - Step Value 1: 4
  - Step Value 2: 24
  - Step Value 3: 48
  - CFG 1: 3.5
  - CFG 2: 7
  - CFG 3: 11
  - Sampler 1: 
  - Sampler 2:
  - Sampler 3:
