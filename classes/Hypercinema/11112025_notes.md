- Mesh Collider is like a shell; Rigid Body is an attribute; Mesh Colliders take more processing power
- Mesh is different from Texture (Materials)



1) Duplicate the plane 5 times

2) rotate each of the planes by setting their X/Y/Z from 0 to 90 -- arrange them to make a box

3) offset their position from 0 to 5 

4) select all your planes, right click and try to make them 1 group

5) give the group a "mesh collider" component so it interacts with every rigid body

6) Add a new object -- cylinder -- and edit its position to be inside the box

- N.b. the Animator is an object Component, which allows you to give it animations.
