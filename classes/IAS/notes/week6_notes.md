# IAS Week 6 Notes
---

- Collaboration - The Principles of Open Innovation; inviting new perspectives

- Final class is Monday 12/8 
- Quick recap, then the group decides on a process
- Go through the ideation & present to the panel

- Prompt: The Ad Council, Love Has No Labels (which was created by R/GA years ago)



- N.b. Empedocles & Love & Strife & Cosmogony; "Love is the most foundational feeling" -- It's unnameable in an age of labels, groups, and divisions
- N.b. Nobody's loveless; it's easy to feel that way for a lot of people, though, because it's hard to detect. Why is that?

Group 2: Vedang, Nava, Rachel, Michelle (6pm onwards)
- Maybe, we each present our own perspective of love... where labels fail to articulate, stories help us gesture at the unnameable. I would say something like "Love isn't pomp and circumstance, or the great relieving of some burden, or a romantic flurry of color... it's almost the opposite. It's why we bear mountains on our back for people who often treat us poorly. It's more than mundane, it's difficult, and inexplicable. Parmenides suggested that nobody's beliefs contain a pointer to the truth, but all beliefs contain a spark, or an afterimage, of the truth -- like an echo. His student, Empedocles, put the generation of all cosmological and political orders in Being within the interplay between a positive/attracting force of Love, in counterstance with Strife or striving. Derrida tells the story of Echo and Narcissus, describing Echo as a water nymph who has no words or image -- no language of her own; she is only able to repeat, to imitate. When Narcissus bends over the water, he sees his own face, as performed by Echo's silent repetition. When he speaks, she repeats his labels by rendering her silence in the shape of his words. Derrida says that in the politics of silence within how Echo repeats, she signs her love. We use the word believe to indicate our impressions of what is real or what is true, and Parmenides tells us what we believe only contains a half-truth which does not necessarily point to the actual truth; instead, the play of Love and Strife arise in what we call "belief" and that is what makes the social world go round and round. Decomposing "belief" into its german roots gives us "be lieb" which says "I love". You see, it's cyclical -- the fictional impression of the world we each hold in our heads, which guides us through our every social political action. There is no rhyme or reason but the rhythm in love within this, and it's hard, and it's silent."

- Today, bringing perspectives into process...

- "I hope you can be everything you want to be, and everything you didn't think was possible" -Melissa
- Open Innovation is the sourcing of innovation from beyond the limits of the corporate system in addition to the entities within the limits (look up Open Innovation WEF)
- Open Innovaion was born in 2003 (sibling to Facemash, Myspace, and LinkedIn)
- Creativity IS Collaborative

- Today's focus is : Android (!)
  - Android was founded on the principles of openness, diversity, and inclusion
  - Android is the world's largest operating system
  - Android powers the Google ecosystem
  - Android's brand has not been very well understood by consumers around the world
    - Android as a brand is though of as "Apple better" rather than as what Android really is
    - How do we bring these values of openness, diversity, and inclusion to the younger consumers through our tech?
    - The center of our digital worlds isn't the tools we use the most, it's why we're driven to use them which creates the helios


1) Approach 3min
2) Context 10min (consider how people experience an OS, and their values)
3) Job 10min (what do people consult/hire Android to address?)
4) Ideation I 10min (Initial thoughts of what Android can do to address the "Job")
5) Collaboration 15min (* Mix the groups! In the middle of the process! Brilliant!)
6) Ideation II 15min
7) Narrative 7min


-* What's the Zig to the Zag? instead of fighting this uphill battle, how do you teleport valence shells? ("what's the zig to the zag!" Instead of Microsoft improving people's workspaces by getting in there, they should acquire LinkedIn (B2B!))
