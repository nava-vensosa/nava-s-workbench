# IAS Week 5 - Context
---

- Today's about thinking about people's motivations and ~elevating insight~
- Next Monday night at the Brooklyn Navy Yard we'll be doing the practical summation
  - People from RGA will be there
  - This Friday we'll focus on Collaboration - principles of Open Innovation; Inviting New Perspectives
- You're not just designing for a person (empathizing), you're also designing for a contet...

- Jobs to Be Done Methodology -- outcome baed innovation

-> JTBD (Jobs to Be Done) Methodology...

- Like the shoe horn! We didn't think "Hm... my shoe needs a horn" ; rather, there was a need -- "getting my shoes on is hard!" -- and iteration led to a solution (the shoe horn)

- "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole" - Theodore Levitt

- The Innovator's Solution - Creating & Sustaining Successful Growth (Clayton Christensen & Michael Raynor)

- "Most innovation is done as an incremental enhancement of existing ideas..." - Don Norman, 1988, The Design of Everyday Things

-> Youtube, Clay Christensen, The Jobs to be Done Theory
  -> McDonalds Milkshake story
  -> "Why do you hire a milkshake in the morning and not something else? Well I tried a banana, but I got hungry pretty quick... hiring a milkshake gets the job done, where the job is I need sugar and to not feel hungry while I make my long commute and have to get myself through til lunch"

- JTBD builds a story not related to a persona but to a context
-> 1) Vision 2) Context 3) Job 4) Need 5) Ideate 6) Prototype 7) Test
-> Define[ 1) 2) 3) 4)] Design [4) 5)] Deliver [6) 7)]

- Daybreaker Raves?
  -> Are you in the business of morning raves? (small market) or are you in the business of morning routines / morning fun? (ahhhh, generally attractive context)

-* Remember last week was service design... this is pretty different, as there's not a persona we have to build, but a context to understand insights of... we don't have to pick people, so much as empathize with general contexts

### In Class Assignment: Applying JTBD to the Hip Hop Museum opening in the Bronx

- There's no shortage of museums in NY, and the Hip Hop Museum is a new concept, in a new devlopment in the Bronx...

- Q: How do we drive community engagement within NYC and make the Hip Hop Museum a success?

1) 2 mins approach
2) 8 minutes vision
3) 15 minutes context
4) 10 minutes job
5) 10 minutes need
6) 20 minutes ideation
7) 10 minutes narrative


- Anectode ... MoMA thought they were a citizen of art, promoting a view of what the world of art is, but they've become a citadel of art -- they became the template, the archetype; vanilla...

-* Badge Value (members only clout)

- Group 1
  - Good Point: 
    - Social Rituals was a good insight; Museum of the Future was a good framing
  - Growth Point: 
    - Could've gotten to the meat of the matter faster
  - Melissa's Feedback:
    - Don't crowd the screen, and when presenting just talk like normal -- you're already charismatic, you don't have to be a "presentation" version of yourself... just talk like usual :)

- Group 2
    - Good Point: 
      - Emerging Artist installation is a great way to grow community, especially since hip hop is such a contemporary medium
    - Growth Point: 
      - How Hip Hop fans engaging with Hip Hop slide -- inconsistent grammar/capitalization (though da club was good); also, people like their phones... was there some ideation about using them to bring people together on site? or did you specifically want to create an alternative for that?
    - Melissa's Feedback:
      - "The Money Page" is the one where people get their phones out and take a picture of it... every good presentation needs a good money page where the audience immediately and concisely gets what's being said

- Our Group:
  - Melissa's Feedback:
    - Bookend your presentations with the sucker punch at the start and stronger at the end... though it's good to have the mind fill in the blanks, you still have to set up the denouement
    - Sometimes, throw in a quesiton which an audience member from your first attempt asked so as to frame the presentation in response to a reasonable person's interested question (for example, why did you choose to end on this slide in particular after the message you had been setting up in the lead up?)
