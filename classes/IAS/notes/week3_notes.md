# Innovation @ Speed - Week 3 Notes
---

- Perspective: Questioning Methodologies; Critical Thinking

- Today's Objectives:
  - Understand the value of questioning methodologies and concepts
  - Discus the importance of candor and crit as part of innovation
  - Feel more confident in approaching and solving for practical cases
    - Feeling more comfortable in giving & receiving feedback

- Crit -- Receiving & Giving Feedback

- Be comfortable saying "I like this" AND "I think this can be better"

- "Why Design Thinking is BS"
  - Presented by a representative of Pentagram Design Group (Natasha Jen)
  - IDEO was the company to really push Design Thinking
  - "Design Thinking" has become a buzzword
  - Crit is missing from Design Thinking!
  - Design Thinking is a good baseline... but it's not the only tool you can use-- you can always be suspicious!
  - Lee's push is that we need more Crit in the process of design collaboration
  - Sometimes, Design Thinking is overly bound to the human-centered pain-point problem... that often leads to a lack of differentiation in response
  - Also, Apple is going to solve a problem very differently than Microsoft!!! That can't be quantified, but we clearly know it to be true!! Design Thinking doesn't keep space for whatever that is...


- Re: Crit
 - Radical Candor: Being able to crit honestly while also demonstrating care
   - Y-Axis: Care Personally; X-Axis: Challenge Directly; -X/+Y: Ruinous Empathy; -X/-Y: Manipulative Insincerity; +X/-Y: Obnoxious Aggression; +X/+Y: Radical Candor
   - Manipulative Insecurity: your Crit doesn't care about your growth -- think about firing someone and giving them feedback (and well wishes); -X/-Y lacks this kind of care
   - Obnoxious Aggression: god, ignore these people... this is pretty rare these days
   - Ruinous Empathy: it doesn't help! Not worth it
   - Radical Candor: The person receiving this will know you care about their growth (that also means you have to execute Care&Directness correctly)

- Q: How do you enter into challenging directly without being ruinous?
  - I mean, part of that is... you just have to be genuine in the moment
  - You have to be willing to piss people off (!?)
  - Give clarity as to where the feedback is coming from; it shouldn't be confrontational ("you are wrong") but rather insightful ("how does it feel if you look at it this way?")
    - Like a bass teacher!

- Q: Sometimes, knowing better is worse because you'll cut people's ideation short prematurely -- how can Crit rearrange the way "knowing better" intervenes to foster growth instead of cutting people short?

- Crit: Making room to have debate within the process!


- Sidenote: in empathizing, ask yourself: what is the brand's POV? Can you say it as a tagline?

- Challenge: Misinformation is EVERYWHERE in the news cycle
  - 85% of Americans believe consuming news from trustworthy sources is important, but only 44% fact-check the sources of what they read
  - BBC's response: Verify
    - Verify is a team of ~60 journalists who use forensic investigative skills and open-source intelligence to fact check statements, verify visual content, counter disinformation, and analyze data; they have a "Verify" Mark for content the team has dug into
    - Goal: Help people set a new standard && encourage people to check their sources
    - Tagline (POV): "We're not here to tell you what to think, we're here to make you think"

- Today's Question: Amidst so much disinformation, how can we encourage more poeple to use BBC Verify and actively check the sources of their news?

1) Approach -- Groundsetting: Who is our team? What are our strengths? How will we proceed?
2) Empathize -- Observe: Gather data, researchl; understand the target audiences
3) Define -- Articulate: What is the problem? What is the specific pain-point?
4) Ideate -- Brainstorm: What are the possible solutions?
5) Prototye -- Design: What is the Minimum Viable Product? What's Feasible/Desirable/Viable?
6) Test -- Design: How 
7) Narrative

NEW PROCESS:
1) Approach - 5min
2) Empathize - 5min
3) Define - 15min* (don't move at the pace of the fastest speaker in th group)
4) Ideate - 20min (let everyone think first before you talk about it)
5) Refine - 10min
6) Narrative - 5min


- What R/GA did in 60 minutes faced with the same prompt:
  - 48 Hours of Sharing Hysteria graph (spike of sharing, stays in the media cycle, disappears over time)
  - Problem Definition: We want to encourage the world to think before they share
  - Add the UNSHARABLE button
    - Fake news spreads like an epidemic -- Rapid Growth over 48 hours ... (Anatomy of a misinformation network, Network Communications 2020)
    - Solution: Can't share this content until it's verified


N.b. Anytime you bring up power, you presume a power dynamic -- to empower a group is to signal to them they don't have it already
N.b. Don't get too in the weeds with technical details when the team is on the clock -- 10 word sentence max to say your piece for that
N.b. This class is all about PERSPECTIVE
N.b. During every approach, make sure you know each person by name and something new about them
N.b. For every Narrative, prepare the powder keg



Group 1-- 
  - "You think before you share" -> "Read, THINK, share"
  - Put the share button at the bottom of the post, not the top -- you have to read to the bottom til you get the chance to share it
    - Backed by research!
  - Melissa's Build: "Add a step to your presentation... Keep the powder dry (don't reveal too soon; powder keg)"

Group 2--
  - Us! We did good on having the narrative be structured and flowing
  - Mobile app could've been grow space
  - Finished a minute early... could've used that, but we did a good job being clear and direct

Group 3--
  - Why do people share?
    - To inform, to react, to belong, to influence, to express opinions
  - Problem
    - People frequently share BBC news content without intentionally verifying its sources, as rapid digital news consumption has become habitual...
  - How Might We (HMW)...?
  - Solution:
    - Visible fact checking button at all times
    - Show that you're sharing verified content when sharing on other platforms
  - Graphic visualization of the solution
    - Built for mobile (done very well)
    - References to other verified platforms reporting on the same news
    - Watermark to go with the fact-checking button
      - Well designed graphically
  - 3 minutes on the dot
  - Melissa's Build: "Signpost for your audience Visually, Audially, and Kinesthetically... the Presentation isn't on the screen -- it's you. It's your entire team. Not your content. Not your solution. It's your presentation."



Leaving Comments...
- You've got design thinking under your belt
- Now, you're thinking about how you give and receive feedback in real time

Assignment:
- Building on your learning today...
- Be very intentional about practicing Crit as part of your daily work. Practice radical candor and see how it feels.
  - N.b. You have to create the space for Critical Feedback explicity and implicitly before you can practice it in session.

Next Week:
  Application -- exploring service design (customer service and what goes wrong with it); Growing Your Toolbox!
