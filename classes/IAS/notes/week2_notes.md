# Week 2 Notes - Innovation at Speed
---

- This week -- Process: Understanding Design Thinking - Foundational Learning
- The weeks: 1) Practice 2) Process 3) Perspective 4) Application 5) Context 6) Collaboration 7) Speed
- The methodology doesn't matter as much as the team's needs, they're just a helpful scaffold
- Case study: Nike
  - RGA worked with Nike over 20 years
  - 90 minutes will be chunked into structured exercises
  - Everyone's presenting/talking... how's yr confidence?
- Innovation is a practice; it's most useful when collaborative; apply people's expertise... Innovation = Process + Impact

-* Design Thinking: A Foundational Approach to Problem Solving
  - example tool: double diamond?
  - Origin of Design Thinking in Industry: IDEO, 1960s-1970s
  - How do we anchor everything we do on solving people's needs first?
    - Need takes 3 forms:
    - What is Desirable? (what do they want)
    - What is Viable? (will deliver from a business perspective)
    - What is Feasible? (can be reasonably done)
  - Step 1: Empathise (What are people's needs?)
    - Interviews, Shadowing, Seek to understand -- nonjudgemental
    - Build a persona for whoever you're designing for!
    - Only when you've learned and undone your own voice in the system, move on to ideation
  - Step 2: Define ()
    - Who am I solving for?
    - What am I solving?
    - How do the people want me to solve it -- what are they looking for?
  - Step 3: Ideate
    - Diverge/Converge
    - All ideas are worthwhile
    - "Yes and" thinking
    - Prioritize
      -* how do you balance Yes& + Prioritize?  --> Sometimes, knowing better is a bad thing, because you'll cut people down before they get a chance to start... you need to create the room to let the ideation happen
      - Find the friction point, and then let the person kind of just take it and blossom
      -* IF YOU ARE TO BLOOM
  - Step 4: Prototype
    - Keep it simple
    - Fail fast
    - Iterate quickly
  - Step 5: Test
    - Understand Impediments
    - What works?
    - Iterate quickly


- Applying to Nike
- They came with: "Sport is known to have a positive impact on a person's well being and confidence, yet girls drop out of sports at twice the rate of boys by age 14."
- Prompt: How can they bring greater inspiration and innovation to women and help boost participation in sport?

- 90 minutes to think; 3 minutes to present in team; 
- Group 1: Nava Omi Ryan Jinnie Vedang

- Process: 
  -* 1) Approach - 10 mins
    - Define how you'll collaborate; Get to know your team; Align on roles (presenter, note taker, time keeper)
  - 2) Empathize - 15 mins
    - Make observations on why women's participation in sport declines from teenage years onward
    - Try having everyone write 3 things down, then go around and share
    - N.b. Insights & Observations are different -- start with Observations, then arrive at Insights
  - 3) Define - 15 mins
    - Of all yr observations, pick 1 specific area you think Nike could get at
    - What is the challenge or pain point you're going to solve for?
    - Reframe the Question
  - 4) Ideate - 15 mins
    - Once you've found your problem, then you can ideate -- but understand, really understand first !!! you should have learned something, there should've been cognitive friction and personal growth before this stage
    - Who could they buy/partner with to address this?
    - What do they already have that could address this?
  - 5) Prototype - 15 mins
    - What's the strongest MVP? How can we test it?
    - NOW you can start thinking Feasible/Desirable/Viable
  - 6) Test - 10 mins
  - 7) Narrative - 10 mins
    - 1) How did your team approach it? 2) Key observations your team made? 3) What you prioritized to solve for 4) Potential ideas 5) which felt most Feasible/Desirable/Viable 6) How would you want to prototype and test?

- WHAT IS YOUR: Clear observation of how people think/feel/behave which founds a key insight


Notes:
- Anything is possible... but Everything isn't
- Make it feel like it was built for them

Feedback:
- Group 3
  - Did well: Focus on lifestyle & holistic health -- very viable, feasible, desirable; very clean
  - Growth point: Who's gonna buy the local sports teams Nike clothes? -> does this dillute Nike's brand or sales?
  - How I could've learned from them: Pointed idea; team had the presentation built with info
  - Melissa's take: Holistic health is underrated, it doesn't always have to be shiny
- Group 2
  - Did well: Sandia Liang Collab
  - Growth point: Play like a girl might not age well... could be seen as diminutive or exclusionary
  - How I could've learned from them: Team was coordinated w/ media and everything, big presentation; clients get frustrated if you don't visualize things
- Group 1
  - Feedback: visualize!


-* N.b. does creativity come from order or chaos?
  - structure can reduce stress and increase space for creativity and creation


- NAQs -- Never Asked Questions
- There's not enough data on women's health to train health products... who's gonna do something about it?


- Homework:
- How design thinking has been applied -- there's a lot of companies that apply design thinking in their methodology (like AirBnB)... 
- Prompt: How could you apply a design thinking approach to your work at ITP outside of this course?
