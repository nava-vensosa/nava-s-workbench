# Week 1 - Innovation at Speed

-* The way we solve problems is getting harder. The way we engage with other people and technology, and the social and technological field we live in keeps changing at a rate we cannot keep up with.

- Weeks:
  - 1) Practice - Getting Uncomfortable
  - Process - Foundational Models; Understanding Design Thinking
  - Perspective - Critical Thinking; Questioning Methodologies
  - Application - Growing your toolbox
  - Context - Elevating Insight
  - Collaboration - Inviting New Perspectives
  - Speed - Importance of Real World Input


- Manchester Union & the Worker Bee (Home of the Industrial Revolution)
- Systems Brain & Advertising
  - Philosophy & Theology & Systems of Belief -> Psychagogia & Narrative
    - Favorite Star Wars Movie? Philosophers you like?
  - Worked at BeReal & now works at R/GA* (is a partner)
    - Superhero Movie Intro Animations in the 70s -> evolved with modern tech
    - Worked with Nike & Google; created Beats
    - Brands might be being made by GPT & Perplexity today -- they heavily influence consumer habits
    - "We Help You Build Intelligent Brand Systems"
    - Google Veo3?


- Today's Problem: How can we reinvent productivity? (from Microsoft)
  - Step 1: Challenge the Question & the Implicit Ambition
    - "No one wants microsoft to reinvent their productivity"
    -> Define a bigger, better opportunity to steer innovation
    -> She needed to understand what Microsoft needed --> they needed to understand their role in a changing world
      - At the time, Google Docs awas eating their lunch
    -> She also needed to understand people's changing needs --> individuals working together for higher impact
      -* INSIGHT is the key necessity in this process, followed by statistical practice -- you'll never be smarter than the people, you'll never be able to understand them firsthand
        -> How do you understand how people feel beyond what the data says?

    -> Somebody said: "What my day feels like: a comic of a balding office man saying "yes master""
    -> She said this to the Microsoft team, and everybody laughed, and then she said: "Behind laughter there's often something true. You thought you were setting people free to be productive in putting the computer to the place it's gotten to; instead, you became the leash."
      -> Microsoft had the OPPORTUNITY to help people realize greater meaning in their work
        -> Great! ...What does that mean?

- Collaboration means I'm working on the same page as you -- Community means I'm working toward the same goal as you
- Individuality -- people need to be able to do work in their own way
- Space -- people need the space to ideate and create
- Growth -- from learning by doing
- Impact -- with physical feedback! that we can see and feel!

Question: To help people grow and find more meaning in their work, microsoft should...
  -> finish the sentence

Working with: Ege, Sai, Vedang, Omi

1) Problem 2) Audience 3) Insight 4) Solution

"To help people grow & find more meaning in their work, microsoft should open a dialog with their user base."

"To help people grow & find more meaning in their work, microsoft should ask. These days, everything's changing. Big corporations don't consider the average guy. Let Microsoft users have a voice in how their experience can change. Open an annual sound design competition -- winners get recognition, artists get paid, and users get the option to tailor their office workflow to their tastes! Give the users options to customize how it looks more easily to reduce eye strain. Give them an optional caretaker timer which gently reminds them to stretch and go outside or look out a window without being annoying. Give people a reason to talk about microsoft outside of the financial times."



- Feedback:
  - Think about yr hook! It matters most! That's what persists for the audience -- it's songwriting!
  - Time effective = time respected
  - Metaphor = Physical; Descriptive = Information blah
  - If given a minute, make it last -- you can't solve anything in a minute, but you can change someone's mind / feeling
  -* "If I own a spade company, with people digging holes all day, I could make a design choice where every handle feels a little more comfortable, and every blade a little sharper"
  - "~I can hear you~" IS A BAD THING! Be still, be silent, be a presence

- What she did:
  - For god's sake, when people have an issue can you just help them with that issue -- understand your users!
  - Community & Growth make work feel more meaningful -- put those buckets together
  -* "To make people grow and find more meaning in their work, Microsoft should buy LinkedIn"
    - Microsoft needed to "have courage in the face of reality" (Nz) -- Google was eating them alive and would continue to. Microsoft's strength lied elsewhere. LinkedIn was actually helping people grow and find community -- now, that's Microsoft too. 
  - Einstein: If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes defining the problem and 5 minutes solving it; it's the other way around when it comes to Advertising
  - If you don't like the problem a client brings you, hone in on a real one.

HOMEWORK:
  - Don't do something for the sake of doing it, do something to be observant and critical
