How Could I Apply a Design Thinking Approach to My Work at ITP Outside of this Course?
---

Design Thinking, as we discussed it, segments into:

1) Approach -- Who is your team, and how will you effectively and holistically collaborate?
2) Empathize -- Who is your client? Who are you about to try to speak for, i.e. who do you represent?
3) Define -- Empathizing takes research; definition narrows that research to a specific pain point your team is addressing
4) Ideate -- Brainstorm responses to the problem
5) Prototype -- Choose your most Feasible, Desirable, and Viable minimal product, determine development & test procedure
6) Test -- Implement, discover break points, gather feedback, revise, iterate
7) Narrative -- Prepare the presentation of your team's approach, observations, prioritiziations, ideas, MVP selection, and prototype/test procedure (whether proposed or performed)

My immediate thought is: all my work should be collaborative, because working in a vacuum is ineffective, and at the end of the day people matter more than the product. My next thought is: holy hell, this is an incredible process. I've been overlooking the Approach -- taking the time to ask "Who am I working with and what are their needs" before asking "What am I working on and what are its needs?" Basing empathy in research, data, and material from the target audience results in higher quality work than presumption can do, and it's a more measurable and actionable process to gather research than it is to make things up. Defining finds your orth star, ideation comes easy for creatives, prototyping is just product design, test is told to you by the work itself-- and then the Narrative, that's the kicker. That's not just your documentation, but how you present it too. That's likely the most important part, and it lasts a minute if you're lucky.

Preparing the Narrative gathers the work of the entire process under it, and it takes serious labor. It also tells your audience exactly who you are and how prepared you were. 

I'm not just thinking about how I can apply this at ITP -- I'm thinking about how I can apply this everywhere in my life. I once asked a mentor how she keeps such a beautiful garden, and she said "I just look at it every day while I drink my coffee. The plants tell you what they need -- the leaves grow dark and heavy when they're overwatered, they bend when they want light, they dry up when they want shade or water. It's not a big deal, you just pay attention with the time you have." The ecology takes care of itself when you take the time to consider and empathize with its constituents; trying to solve problems doesn't do that.

This is a very physical skill I have to learn. I'm glad to be cognitively aware of this now, but it's scary to be staring down. It's a big change, and it's a good change, I just fear I might not rise to the challenge. So little ego and such a deliberate pace are essential, and consistency is key... these are difficult skills to maintain. What a tremendous lesson.
