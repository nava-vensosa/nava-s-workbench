# Citing AI

1. In your codebase, create a directory called "Citations"

2. In that directory, maintain either 1 markdown file or a tree of organized files. In this/these file(s), you should log all the prompts you submitted to the LLM you were using

3. In your actual code, use a comment with an APA citation, or an MLA citation, and also indicate which file in your "Citations" directory corresponds to that prompt
