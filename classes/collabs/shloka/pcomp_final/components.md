# PComp Final Components
---

- Materials we have so far:
  - quarter inch wood panels


- Final Dimensions:
  - W: 14" ; L: 12" ; H: 8" (triangular)
    - Hollow trapezoidal chassis
    - On the surface of the chassis, there's a holder shaped to receive a sphere/bowl
    - Bottom right corner of the slanted surface -- There's a square hole for the RFID or Hall Effect Sensor; the hole scans the input object, then a pipe carries that object to a square holder (think skee ball)
    - There's an inscription of the instructions in the top left
    - There's a second bowl holder for the main assembly

1) User approaches this trapezoidal chassis
2) There's a litle skee ball receptacle feeding them pieces
3) On the chassis, there's a container receptacle (top right) which holds the components
4) in the center of the chassis, there's an assembly stage for them to put together the russian doll of the atom
5) In the bottom right, there's a scan & drop section for the user to transfer objects from the component receptacle to the skee ball receptacle


Notes to self:
1) There's going to be a ring for the hydrogen atom
2) The user is building a hydrogen atom
3) they slot the ring into place after they've built the nucleus
4) the nucleus is built of quarks (fermions)
5) the ring is a lepton (fermion; hydrogen)


UX: 1) Approach 2) Read 3) Follow instructions to deconstruct then reconstruct the atom

- This is purely nuclear; the hydrogen ring doesn't move, it just sits there; the electron cloud is just LEDs
