# 3/4 Club - README

The Three Quarters Club is a writing ring hosted on this blog. Each week, we write a sample for a prompt. Writing samples can be argumentative, poetic, satirical, prosaic, or anything. The goal is to write something Three Quarters good enough to let see the light of day, and to build a community for writing practice accountability and peer review
