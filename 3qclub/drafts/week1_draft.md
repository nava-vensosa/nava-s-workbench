**Hephaestus & the Demiurge**

Down in the place where the people are, in the public space, Hephaestus wraps his hand around a hammer and begins.


There's something going on with time I'm missing here. It's technics *and time*, or Sennett's "Note on History - The Shortness of Time" or something else. I don't see time yet, I'm still trying to catch up with my hand. It points, it curls, it curves, it moves, it plays. When my words fail to get across what I'm trying to say, my hands always prevail. 

Hetero-geneity, genetic; the potential energy between two lines of sight in parallax -- a metastable system --; is this kronos/aeon? the time split?
