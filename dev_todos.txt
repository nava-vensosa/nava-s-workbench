I want to make a content loader for my website. Currently hosted on Neocities, ideally I would like to have all my files uploaded to the static site folder-- html, js, and css files for the pages, and .pngs for images used in the pages, but then also text or markdown files which contain plain text content. Instead of writing the text content to the html pages directly in <p></p> containers, i want to enter something like a content hook which is referencing the appropriate plain text file, and loads its contents in as formatted by the css.
