# What is the Presence of a Particle?

This essay is more social than scientific. The question is: What is the presence of a particle or body?

To be reductive, let's say of physical bodies there are fields and particles.
1. A particle may be easier to think about, but harder to define-- whereas a field may be harder to think about and easier to define
  - I say this because the epiphenomena of erratic behavior and superposition in a particle make it impossible to define, while a field can be fairly effectively described with QFT.
2. One question at hand is: how does a body which is a particle differ from a body which is a field?
3. Metaphors which shed light on aspects of fields:
  - Manifold
  - Relation
  - Emergent defolrmation as construction
  - Container for bodies
  - A relative frame for present measurement
  - A medium, not unlike a dielectric
4. Of small bodies, there are bosons and fermions -- eaach of which have two types.
  - A recap of the standard model (in the parenthases are Mass, Charge, Spin):
    - Gauge Bosons
      - gluon (0, 0, 1)
      - photon (0, 0, 1)
      - Z boson (~91.188 GeV/c^2, 0, 1)
      - W boson (~80.3692 GeV/c^2, +/-1, 1)
    - Scalar Bosons
      - Higgs (~125.2 GeV/c^2, 0, 0)
    - Quarks
      - up (~2.16 MeV/c^2, 2/3, 1/2)
      - charm (~1.273 GeV/c^2, 2/3, 1/2)
      - top (~172.52 GeV/c^2, 2/3, 1/2)
      - down (~4.7 MeV/c^2, -1/3, 1/2)
      - strange (~93.5 MeV/c^2, -1/3, 1/2)
      - bottom (~4.183 GeV/c^2, -1/3, 1/2)
    - Leptons
      - electron (~5.11 MeV/c^2, -1, 1/2)
      - muon (~105.66 MeV/c^2, -1, 1/2)
      - tau (~1.77693 GeV/c^2, 0, 1/2)
      - electron neutrino (<2.2 eV/c^2, 0, 1/2)
      - muon neutrino (<1.7 MeV/c^2, 0, 1/2)
      - tau neutrino (<15.5 MeV/c^2, 0, 1/2)

These bodies concretely exist, can be found and measured... fields may not exist; instead, it's possible a "field" is nothing more than a limiting and useful metaphor by which our cognition may imagine and situate these bodies into presence or relation. Perhaps the universe is one hyperdimensional singularity, but for one being locked into 3D space only a heavily reduced cross-section of a local region is apparent (or imaginable). This is an inaccuracy baked into our cognitive faculty -- a deficiency we must press on despite.
