This has been rattling around in my head for a couple days: if we tend to accept the love we think we deserve, what does the love we reject say about us?

I've always been the kind of person to put the matter before the person. That doesn't really work when you're learning to be a teacher. It occurred to me that my obsessive loves -- physics, music, poetics, etc. -- might be an attempt at externalizing love and attention away from myself. I am reckoning with the limits of my intelligence as I notice myself getting older; things are harder to pick up, I'm slower at learning things. This sense of haste -- to learn quickly -- is something I've convinced myself is in service of the work, and I put the work before myself. I'm slowly learning that the work needs me to put myself before the work, to go at my actual pace -- to measure, bend, pivot, adjust. With no more singers, there would be no song; why do I reject the singer in me? 

I don't let myself believe I deserve the nearness I can conjure up. Maybe I should loosen my grip on such matters, and let myself feel the wind in my hair, on my skin, in my sail.
