I. Aeolian-Skinner

The pipe organ at Grace Cathedral has an arryhthmia. The real gem of San Francisco is Trinity Episcopal's Aeolian-Skinner. I'll introduce this essay's premise by discussing these machines

I've done surgery on both Trinity & Grace Cathedral's 4-manual Aeolian-Skinner pipe organs. Having 4 manuals means the pipes controlled by the console are grouped in 4 main chambers (though, Grace Cathedral packs twice as many ranks of pipes into its chambers). A chamber is a small wooden box -- smaller than a cheap Midtown Manhattan studio. The chambers are lofted dozens of feet in the air, and filled with pipes of different shapes, materials, and sizes. These pipes make different kinds of sounds depending on their size and type. More importantly, they deform each others' sounds depending on their proximity, orientation, installation, and the shape of the chamber. The chamber is a mixing station -- each pipe must sound good, mix well with the rest of its chamber-mates, and speak such that the chambers sound balanced in tuning, texture, and volume. Electrical and pneumatic control systems must be stuffed in with the pipes, through channels of cheap poplar ladders and planks. 

A well-kept Aeolian-Skinner sounds angelic, but the real genius of their design does not lie in the perfection of their sound. Aeolian-Skinner designed their organs to be maintained. 

How is this different from an Austin organ? Austins are perfectly modular and pressure sealed -- their insides are a small rectangular box, whose walls are like chests of drawers. Technicians can sit semi-comfortably, easily hear where the organ is malfunctioning, pull out the drawer, fix it, and return the components where they belong. It's easy to implement and easier to maintain. Aeolian-Skinners are way different. When you step into the guts of an Aeolian-Skinner, it's like staring down a retro-mechanical jungle, begging you to delve into its secret corners. You can hear everything -- every mechanism, every pipe. It sounds divine from the inside, and as you dart around the intestines of this giant machine, hours pass and you realize you never once were in an uncomfortable position, nor did you bump into anything accidentally, nor did you ever feel lost or confused.
