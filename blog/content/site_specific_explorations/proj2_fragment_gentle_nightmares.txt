In dreams, like compounding waves, I have been seeing
   what might have been,
   what won't have been,
   what never should have been, despite our scheming...

Time & fantasy & images of what I saw in futures severed from the moment/ary I am in\ repeat in dreams like flashbacks of days I have yet to know... Days I'll never know, for dreams don't linger.

They are gathered there -- the women & the friends --, gathered in the absence, in the images of dreams. They are acting strangely, the women of my dreams' nightmarish & calm.

Daytime's a different color. Their voices are more real than how I've known  them while awake. Time has crumpled like a ball -- a fallacious axiom falling in on itself, echoing in dreams of friendship & family completely out of tome... Awake, I know I have all the time in the world, and that's not a lot of time; my dreams are out of time. That's why they haunt me, lingering in daydreams.

I see a crib. Picnics in parks with jean&corduroy coats. Homecoming dresses in warmly lit living rooms I subconsciously conjured up. It's gentle, & what could have been, & maybe what I wanted. It is warm, & worse than any nightmare. I wake up & I could cry if I chose to but am calm, & it lingers. I know I'll have gentle dreams of her again.
