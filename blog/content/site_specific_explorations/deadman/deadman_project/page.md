# Deadman

Jaye and I met at Prospect Park, near the zoo. We walked a nearby trail as I gave an overview of what we were about to do and the rules of engagement. The sound of a lighter clicking would transition between the 3 scenes: The Walk Out, The Dreamwalk, and The Return.

## Part 1: The Walk Out
<hr class="divider">

To echo the experiences in Jaye's dream of witnessing, towing along behind, and being restricted in action, Jaye walked behind me, filming with an old video camera. Her mobility for expression lay in what she chose to put in frame, and how she chose to move the camera; the footage will become part of The Return.

## Part 2: The Dreamwalk
<hr class="divider">

Near the end of the path we were walking, Jaye was to freeze -- as if she were a camera built into a tree in the woods. In this section, Jaye made the choice to zoom in on the lips rather than framing the face to preserve the sense of anonymity and personlessness in hear dream. As we concluded the Dreamwalk, I recited some verse I had written on the content of her dream:


Take what waking lies away.
Learn to sleep another way.
Let the sleeping dream again
to dream tomorrow is another day.

It seems I am alone in this bed,
Swaddled in these messy sheets of air
thick with messy words unsaid.
Dreamers all tell lies instead
Of what philosophy may conjure--
Heaven, virtue, bloodless sheets.
We lie and bleed asleep instead,
dispossessed of our noble nature,
doffed of music, memory,
as we venture in ambiguity
disarming our very selves.

And April is an awful month.
The rains of March have dreadful eyes.
They fill the streets with mud and grime,
And leave you when you open up.
Bleed out your eyes,
Call it crying, if you will.
Dream that no one ever lies
When their words stand still.

## Part 3: The Return

"We are like the dreamer who dreams, and then lives inside the dream"

The verse and tone involved in this project were inspired by Twin Peaks & T.S. Eliot. The third and final site is a video (still in the works) which combines the footage Jaye shot with a second set of verse, drawing the commentary on dreams, reality, language, and psychagogia to its conclusion.


There's a place at the end
Of where I am
Where I begin
To stretch out
From in my bed,
To breathe, to sleep,
To walk again.
A dreamwalk is a lonely occupation.
Do you think there can be such a place,
Such a feeling
Where the real is like a dream?
Shall I say,
dreamwalk with me?

Has anybody got a light?
Has anybody got a light?
Anybody? Anybody got a light?
Has anybody got a light?
