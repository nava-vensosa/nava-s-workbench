Deadman is drowning. Jaye tried to stop him, but she couldn't; in the dream she had no strength. 

Deadman has no face; she wants to be him. She doesn't know who he is; in a way, he might be her. 

It's warm, and the grass is damp. They're walking, as the dark is setting, and the last fading blue of sky's expired, or has yet to come. 

Deadman's walking on the street turned to running. At the riverside, he tried to cross the bridge, and then he jumped. Jaye, scared, woke up.
