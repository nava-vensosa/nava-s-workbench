Song of Jaye's Dream: "Deadman" - KUN

Jaye saw a man ahead of her at blue hour. She remembers misty air, petrichor, thunder and lightning far off. She followed him, walking, not knowing why. The rain tasted sour. 

Deadman was an anchor, a sleeping song. It takes her there.

The thunder's in the distance; it is no longer raining. She feels lonely and free... like walking the streets alone so late it's early out.

Deadman seems heartbroken. Jaye finds him familiar, but can't recall. He's a collage of people she's known before... people she knows... familiar men and women she can't recognize. They have no face in dreams, or their faces are hard to recall.

The rain is part of the freedom. No umbrella -- never owned one. Sometimes, you get iannoyed getting wet. It's annoying here too, in this dream... it paints the loneliness.

It's darker than the bluing sky.
