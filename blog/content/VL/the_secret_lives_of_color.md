# The Secret Lives of Color - 99% Invisible

I appreciated the historical, material, and cultural attention extended to color in this podcast episode. The crush of red from stone, the story of the purple shellfish and Perkin's accidental attic invention of mauve -- these were beautiful and fascinating stories. Kassia St. Clair's depth of research is inspirational, and her skill at storytelling has made me want to read her full book. The way she told these historical anecdotes reminds me of Andreea Wulf's "Magnificent Rebels" which is my favorite historical narrative I've read so far -- she tells the history almost as dramatically as a victorian novel, but with clear language and dense citations. Color is so heavily interwoven in works of Diderot and Wittgenstein I've been obsessed with for years -- hearing St. Clair's take on color added an entirely new dimension to color which I hadn't seen before. I think of color in terms of colorspace and trichromacy proportioning algorithms, or the Planck-Einstein Relation E = hf, or as something grammatical in the case of Wittgenstein, or synesthetic in the cases of Diderot & D'Alembert -- and all this while, I've never seen the social, historical, and ancient economic life of color. Careening through this history is a new narrative path I'm excited to explore in reasoning, research, and articulation in my broader fascination with color; I'm excited to engage further with St. Clair's work.
