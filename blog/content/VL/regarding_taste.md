# Regarding Taste

A cornerstone of my taste is the Gemini protocol. It's an alternative internet to HTTPS. Everything on Gwmini is text based -- the entire Gemini web could probably fit on a 2006 iPod. You can access it from any computer terminal, and navigate it with keystrokes. Why do I love Gemini? It's just people and their words, libking the relations and inspirations shaping them, parsed through a physical interface I adore -- keystrokes. It's one massive webring. Growing up, I'd get lost in either playing the piano or surfing webrings to find stories and underground music communities. A main attractor in Gemini is the lack of visual design -- there's no capacity for visuals; it's like mainlining people's personalities. The invisible and tactile humanity in the poetic moment of one person meeting the words of another's is the core of my personal taste.
