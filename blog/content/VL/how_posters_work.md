# How Posters Work - Ellen Lupton

At the start of ''How Posters Work,'' Ellen Lupton displayed two images of a forest -- one, a thicket of thin crossing logs, and the other a lush curving path. She asked which one looked more inviting, and I got it wrong. I thought the thicket was mysterious and would be fun to crawl through, while she said the colors of the path were inviting and the space opened up while the other was closed off. So, when she got to the part where she discussed how some designers make the posters intentionally hard to read in order to convey an aesthetic argument, I knew I wouldn't want to do that-- because, I feel like I see things weird.  Rather, the Albert Exergian posters she showed on TV shows particularly struck me, and I wanted to build the poster with geometric forms. I liked the outlines of the black bulb she showed, and tried incorporating that into giving Helvetica dimensionality to create information hierarchy in the info section. I took inspiration from Zurich Jazz Festival posters -- which used colorful curves to mirror the text of the word ''Jazz'' --, and tried to select geometries and use color and perspective to represent a bit of what ITP's aesthetic is -- a simplified, computerized hyperspace where perspective warps and groups in hopefully accessible ways.
