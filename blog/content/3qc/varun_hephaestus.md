Hephaestus
**10 / 31 / 2025, Varun Srivastava**

## Three thousand years ago, Homer strained his memory and recalled what was said about the great inventor Hephaestus...

May 2025 - Meta pays $14bn for a majority stake in Scale AI. Its founder, 28-year old Alexander Wang, is put in charge of Meta's "superintelligence team"...

## Hera hurled Hephaestus down from heaven, ashamed at her son's lameness. But he made use of his skills. Having been rescued in the ocean by Nereids he made many things -- some for Thetis (by whom he had been rescued), and others for her sisters Eurynome and Metis -- but he also cunningly fashioned a throne with invisible chains, and this he sent unto his mother as a gift. And she was very delighted by this gift, and she sat on it and golden handcuffs bound her, and she found herself captive, and there was none among the immortals who could loose her bonds.

June 2025 - Mark Zuckerberg compiles a masterlist of top AI engineers and researchers across the globe for his superintelligence team. Sam Altman claims packages of $100mn are offered to OpenAI's top talent in an effort to lure them to Meta.

Stealth startup Thinking Machine announces its co-founders, including Mira Murati (ex-CTO of OpenAI), John Schulman (OpenAI cofounder), and Andrew Tulloch (ex-engineer at PyTorch). They immediately raise $2bn.

## And so the gods of Olympus were distraught at the capture of Hera, knowing not what might be done. Taking counsel together they agreed to send Ares; yet when he came unto that place, naught did he accomplish, but retreated in disgrace, for Hephaestus threatened him with blazing torches. And seeing Hera in such grievous distress, Dionysus comes, bearing sweet wine and a mule.

July 2025 - Zuckerberg's efforts have paid off, and Meta's superintelligence team is now forged of over a dozen ex-OpenAI researchers. OpenAI announces a week of total shutdown. All technical staff is given mandatory paid vacation. 

Waves of defections are announced from all major companies: OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, SSI.

Zuckerberg tries to buy startup Thinking Machine Labs outright. Upon failure he tries to recruit one of its co-founders, Tulloch -- who previously worked at Meta for 11 years -- for a reported 9-figure pay package. Tulloch rejects...

## Hephaestus sees his brother, Dionysus, and trusts him, and so he accepts his honeyed wine, and drinking deep thereof falls into drunken slumber. Then does Dionysus lay the sleeping god upon the back of the mule, and wrapping his tools, secures them likewise to the beast. And gently he brings them with the mule to the court of Olympus among the gods, and there before Zeus their father are the twain brought to stand.

August 2025 - Draft season has hit all the major labs. Presiding from high hills of Pac Heights, jealous CEOs watch their forces reshuffle. Offers outrun replies, compute is pledged, compensation packages have gone stratospheric.

TBPN puts out the "Metis List" -- a live leaderboard of the top 100 AI researchers in the globe -- as well as baseball-card graphics of researchers who are traded between labs.

## Zeus the Father says to Hephaestus "All that thy heart desires shall be thine, if thou wilt free Queen Hera from her bonds,"

## and Hephaestus says, "Then let it be that I return to high Olympus, to take my place among the immortal ones," and Zeus says, "So be it,"

## and Hephaestus says, "And then let me have the most beautiful among the goddesses, golden Aphrodite, as my wife," and Zeus says, "So be it,"

## and Hephaestus, marveling at what he has been granted, knows not what more to ask. Yet do his discerning eyes fall upon the creations of the Cyclopes -- the mighty bolt of Zeus, and the earth-shaker's trident, and the helm of Hades -- and in his heart there stirs a great longing. "Grant me this also, Father, that I might forge the arms of the eathless gods of Olympus,"

## and Zeus says, "So be it."

October 2025 - Tulloch leaves Thinking Machine Labs for Meta, with a compensation package reported to be up to $1.5bn.

## Thetis ran through the sea until she reached the bronze house of Hephaestus on Olympus, and entering the great hall of his forge, she was made to sit on a silver-studded chair.

## Seeing her Hephaestus leaned away from the fire, and gathered his tools up in a silver chest, and wiped his face and hands and neck and chest with a sponge, and grasped a stout staff, and hobbled toward Thetis; but there moved swiftly to support their lord came automatons of gold, fashioned in the image of maidens. In them is the understanding in their hearts, and in them speech and strength, and they know cunning handiwork by the gift of their immortal artisan.

## These busily moved to support their lord, and he, limping night, sat upon a shining chair opposite of Thetis and grasps her by the hand, "Speak what is in thy mind; my heart bids me fulfill it."
