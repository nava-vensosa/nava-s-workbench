## Hephaestus

On the day ordained by Zeus when beings were set to individuate into the world, Titan Epimetheus, whose name was "Afterthought", was tasked with imbuing each being with an essential nature. In his forgetfulness, Epimetheus ran out of elements to dispense when he arrived at the final creation: mankind. His brother, Prometheus, whose name was "Forethought", anticipated nature's need for mankind to have some essential element about their nature. Prometheus stole into Olympus, took a fragment of the Ouranic gods' fire, and gave it to the chthonic steward, mankind. This gave man agriculture & bronze -- propogating proprietary requisition, means of production, war, and the rape of nature. Zeus said, "Look what you've done!" and bound Prometheus to eternal torture atop Mount Kaukasos in Scythia. 

This is not where Sennett begins "The Craftsman", but it sets the stage for his discussion of Pandora's casket.

Hephaestus, the god of technology -- characterized as fire rising from the earth, volcanic & chthonic --, created the first woman from clay: Pandora, a child & "goddess of invention"; the "bitter gift of all the gods." Upon opening her casket, Pandora released weapons into the world -- metal, agriculture, murder. As Oppenheimer wrote in his journal upon completion of the Atom Bomb, Pandora embodied the expression: "I am become Death, destroyer of worlds."

Pandora's casket within us all is our nature as technological -- the fire put in us; "homo faber" -- man as fabricator, man as maker; man as craftsman, as "autopoetic holobiont"; man as cyborg, man as cybernetic/linguist. The moral dilemmas of technology, its design and origin, and its social and ecological repercussions become complicated by the confrontation with our nature as coextensive with the invention of and engagement with technical objects and technicity inherent in our every mode of being. In the act, Hephaestus simply swings his hammer, but the technical act generates and genders Empedoclean cosmogenesis -- that is, world and world-building.

An Afterthought, before gnosis: Mnemosyne -- the mother of the muses, whose name gives us the word "memory" -- is at play in Epimetheus's forgetfulness, setting the stage for Prometheus's tragedy. How does this hamartia (tragic flaw) of Mnemosyne as an afterthought & Prometheus's hubris in presupposition play a role in the act of creative innovation and playful design?
