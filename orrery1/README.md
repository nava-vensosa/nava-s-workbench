# Orrery 1

Inspired by the Antikythera Mechanism, the Orrery works are a series of mechanical adaptations of my ASRP, Astrid.

This is the first installment of the Orrery works, subtitled 'Milling Metronomy' for its resemblance to planetary ball mills and its impinging on Heraclitus's kosmos, metron, & nomos.
