# Orrery: Milling Metronomy
---
*Orrery: A Planetary Mechanism*
*Milling: A nod to the inspiration taken from planetary ball mills*
*Metronomy: A reference to the work's being in conversation with Heraclitean fragments on kosmos, metro, and nomos*

### Components we anticipate needing to model:
1. Drive Train
2. Optional Tensor Ring
3. Control Station
4. Trammels (4x)
5. Rotating Trammel Base (4x)
6. Composition Disc (4x)
7. Platform

### Descriptions: 
1. Drive Train: Rotary motor + system of gears driving the mechanism's components' motion
2. Tensor Ring: Mostly cosmetic; indicates the clock rate of the drive train
3. Control Station: Where the user can control clock rate, Trammel Ranges & Rotations, and other MCU Parameters
4. Trammels: Drives the orbital motion triggering sends
5. Rotating Trammel Base: Controls/Automates offset for the Trammel's Ellipse
6. Composition Disc: Tracks sends for the user to control rhythm
7. Platform

### Improvements on the Design:
1. Instead of percussive gears for sends, use a light sensor and Black/Wyhite dots, with a black track
2. More minimal design for the drive train-- don't distract attention from the musical design
3. Write the purpose of how it works, what the intention behind the design demonstrates about rhythmic composition

### Further collaborations
1. Ask Danny Rozin about good light sensors for this application, as well as what kind of motor he would recommend
2. Meet with Ethan Hein and ask his input

### Actions:
1. OH With Danny Rozin maybe next Monday?
2. OH with Ethan in the second week of October?
3. Prototype Blueprinting session scheduled for this wendesday-- will be modeling the variable track trammel, its rotary platform, and the composition disc (Paper blueprint first, then FreeCAD or Blender)
