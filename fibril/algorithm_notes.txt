1) Bayesian Inference:

i. Let there be 'n' bodies, where 'n' corresponds to a frequency or MIDI note

ii. For our first implementation, n = 127, where each body corresponds to a MIDI note. In implementation, each body will be an element in a list, containing a probability value.

iii. Each element will determine its probability by crunching ''given'' rules-- P(A | Z), where Z is a set of rules (B, C, ...). How will we determine these rules?

iv. The set of rules which determine our Bayesian inferences  are derived from: GC_Input, Placement_Sliders_Config, Color_Drawbars_Config. GC_Input is interpreting intuitive gestures from the ranks, impacting voice leading, spread, color density, and placement-- not necessarily color choice. Placement_Sliders_Config is an experimental feature which lets the user draw a curve and slide it left/right to directly control placement variance in the algorithm (this shiild have a strength knob, effectively bounding the range of placement options for the GC_Input). Color_Drawbars_Config pertains to the drawbars whose relative position biases the probabilistic weighting of the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 intervals upon the root of what is played in a rank.

v. The list of n bodies can be graphically shown as a box segmented into 127 boxes, which resize as the algorithm marches until a static state is reached, upon which the dice are rolled and a box/body is swlected. The body corresponding to what is selected will be added to the map of what is about to voice, and the algorithm will re-roll against the new map, until the quota is reached.
