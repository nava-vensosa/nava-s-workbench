Astrid/Antikythera is a speculative archaeology project that reimagines ancient computing devices through the lens of contemporary feminist technology studies. Drawing connections between the Antikythera mechanism—the ancient Greek analog computer—and contemporary artificial intelligence systems, this project explores how gender, power, and knowledge intersect in computational cultures across millennia.

The project presents Astrid as a fictional AI archaeologist who discovers fragments of future computing devices that challenge linear narratives of technological progress. Through interactive installations, digital artifacts, and speculative documentation, Astrid/Antikythera asks: What if ancient technologies were more sophisticated than we assume? What if future technologies are more primitive than we hope?

The work combines 3D printed reconstructions of speculative ancient devices, interactive digital interfaces, and performance elements that blur the boundaries between historical research, speculative fiction, and critical design. Participants engage with pseudo-archaeological evidence that suggests alternative timelines of technological development, challenging assumptions about innovation, progress, and the gendered nature of technological knowledge.
