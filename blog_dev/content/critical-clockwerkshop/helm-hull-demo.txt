The demonstration features a full-scale navigation station where participants learn traditional and speculative wayfinding techniques through hands-on practice. Using working sextants, wind vanes, and biological indicators alongside speculative future instruments, participants practice navigation in simulated post-GPS scenarios where technological infrastructure has become unreliable.
