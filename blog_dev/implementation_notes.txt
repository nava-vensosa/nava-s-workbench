2. write the content loader script
3. assemble what we have for testing
4. organize the content we have
5. implement the content for my classes

N.b. Add the Dialectics Performance Piece (what was its name?) and the Physical Modelling Project... remember the TOBI thing goes with On Cartography

N.b. For every Project, have zithers drawn and metaphors on hand for audience experiences, user experiences, presentations, and pitches; put these on the project pages!

N.b. maybe introduce a new project about the zithers of space and storytelling or something (see Hypercinema Week 2 Class Notes / Digest!; it's a Zimoun piece made into a literary experience... Talk with Gabe about this, build this idea, let it catch like seriously!!!)
  -This could highkey be the solution to yr theory speaking problem-- if you could make the path also a zither through the thesis....

N.b. Riding off the cabinet of curiosities... design an instrument-- a digital pipe organ-- where pulling out the stops is a variable way of triggering notes (the further out, the louder the note; maybe different positions change pitch for key changes or microtonality... maybe there's a spring action on the stops if they're extended one way so the user can trigger motion like with the hyperbass... maybe limit it to 4 voice polyphony & work towards a cover of Blue Orleans! Again, Week 2 Hypercinema)
