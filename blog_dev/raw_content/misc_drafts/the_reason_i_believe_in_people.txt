I don't have a good reason for believing in people. It's not a good thing. I have seen people in genuine trouble. I have seen them live through their trouble unidealistically. I've watched loved ones from the sidelines, helpless, as they struggle through challenges I can't fathom. I've been to the depths of my own oceans, too, where no one else could go. I'm still here. These people I love who have borne unimaginable loss still live with it. I don't believe in people because I find their potential to be inspiring, I believe in people because I've seen them get through worse, and that's not a good feeling. It really doesn't feel good, but when I see somebody at their limit or I feel at the limit myself, I can't help but think "Oh no, this isn't rock bottom yet, there's hell to pay between here and there." It's weirdly calming, knowing it can be that bad... it helps me feel belief, and the warmth of the sun, and the little quiet turbulence of a breeze. It feels like "We've suffered so we can have our little moments of quietude, the times when we can laugh and not think about the trouble." Maybe I like troubling art so much because surviving through a troubling piece reassures me that despite all our genuine trouble and our poor ways of living with it, we get that little quiet, that reserve of calm between the hardship.
