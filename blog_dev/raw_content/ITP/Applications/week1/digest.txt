Q:
-Think of a group of friends you feel supremely comfortable with-- how can that energy of openness and play be brought into the classroom?
-Think of what you do to get to know a new person... reflect on that, and consider how it might help or hinder classroom dynamics if you were to lean in or change some aspect of that.
-Think of the room in which this class is being taught-- what helps or hinders you capacity to engage in playful and attentive learning? What can you do to improve or lean into it?


Reflection:
It's barely been a week and I'm already learning a lot about myself as a student and it's terrifying. It turns out I'm deeply uncompromising on the matter of study, and that's a serious detriment to openness and collaboration, as I have a tendency to focus on the work over the sensitivities people I'm working with. I think this stems from an understanding that deep attentiveness to an instrument and the music in the air brings out the quality of the player-- the way in which somebody plays their instrument tells you a lot about how they think about life--, but that does not extend the same beyond the craft of instrumentality. In the words of Fugazi: "We need an instrument to take a measurement to find out if loss could weigh." That's something I need to grow out of; my obsession with measurement in presocratic poetics and quantum physics fundamentally does not carry over into applications in collaborative learning, and this is a serious personal growth journey I hope unfolds throughout this class... Nyla helped me understand the pharmakon: for every person I interact with, I'd like to learn what's their element-- what puts them there, what they're like there, what it is.
