Q:
How can you intelligently design, prototype, and pitch a piece you want to secure funding for and scale up?


Reflection:
Storytelling is the BACKBONE of sound art and sound installation experience design... it would be good to both have zithers and metaphors prepared for every audience experience, user experience, elevator pitch, and presentation!

Project Ideas:
-Microcosm of the Legion of Honour Pipe Organ-- the experience of hearing the sound in an open space, then entering the smaller space and having both the sound and your knowledge of it open up; playing with darkness/illumination... prototype it in a phone booth!
-"Stop and Slide" Instrument-- something that feels like pulling out stops and sliding them around to play compositions akin to the Hyperbass... perhaps capacitive knobs trigger a note when touched, and there's 4 organ pedal keys to either sustain or pluck/mute the 4 tracks, with notes decaying... how would we do harmonics? Dynamic control? Maybe the left hand has a capacitive touch, and the right hand deals with knobs and other mechanisms, sort of like you're in a cockpit...


Quick Action Items:
-Send Fumi the Pamela Z piece
-Bring in Unflattening Next Week
-Maybe plan a date or squish thing at Viola's Room
-go see the Christine Kim piece at the Whitney
