-* How do you curate a site-specific experience?
-Mia works in theater, film, experience design with brands, companies, etc.
-Thinking (literally) outside the box/frame of the room
-How many ways can you create a 360deg performance?
-How do we create immersive experiences for audiences
-New relationship to space/site
-New relationships to contexts (the WHERE of placing, making, receiving art/performance)
-Design with an organizing principle you want people to walk away with in mind; how are we redefining the relationship between performer, audience, and art?
-Safety & Controlled Chaos in a site-specific artwork
-New social contracts, models, transactions ?!?!!?
-*Controlled spaces (theaters, concert venues, museums, haunted houses, airports):
  -What do these spaces accommodate?
  -Where do we assume the audience should be?
  -How will the audience know when it starts and ends?
  -How do we know if we can interact or not?
-*When yr working site specifically, the site will mess with you-- the HVAC, etc.--, and being able to adapt to those sudden changes will make the art better than if you try to control the chaos the wrong way
-Q: what does site-specific mean to you?
  -Jennie C. Jones vs. Legion of Honour
-Controlled Space (Institutional Space; Concert Venue, Museum, Park, Theater... ***A Site is NOT a Controlled Space, it has unplanned elements baked into it)
  -Outside the Box!
-Q: What does immersive mean to you?
  -The audience is not a consumer, but instead experiencing movement-- either moving through the work, or moving as medium for the work... is this anti-media?
-Immersion blurs the boundary between art and viewer; it engages the senses, it's a holistic 360deg experience about a field and not a frame of vision; it's Participatory and/or Interactive
-*Go check out BAM-- Brooklyn Academy of Music (Hub of experimental & international interdisciplinary work)
-Banal places can suddenly become magical because of what they're juxtaposed with!
-If you can strike the audience with a sense that suddenly gravity has been redirected, or invoke in them physical anxieties of "oh, I don't want to jump into that water" you can immediately immerse them in some aspect of performance!
  -You can set the rules of the world... and during the experience, you can break them too... works better if you've dulled them down with noise and long exposure
  -"prime people, teach them the rules of the space... then flip them on their side"
