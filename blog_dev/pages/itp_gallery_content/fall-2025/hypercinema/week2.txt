Started with discussion of physical/psychoacoustic phenomena - sonic lasers; GCT Whispering Gallery & Berkeley's Half-Shell; a sonic score for a city or a subway. Listening is more personable than hearing; hearing might be more physical.

Storytelling is the BACKBONE of sound art and sound installation experience design... have zithers and on-hand metaphors for every audience experience, user experience, elevator pitch, and presentation.

Q: How can you intelligently design, prototype, and pitch a piece you want to secure funding for and scale up?

Project Ideas:
- Microcosm of the Legion of Honour Pipe Organ-- the experience of hearing the sound in an open space, then entering the smaller space and having both the sound and your knowledge of it open up
- "Stop and Slide" Instrument-- something that feels like pulling out stops and sliding them around to play compositions akin to the Hyperbass
