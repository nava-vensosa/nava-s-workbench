The "Caught You___" demonstration provides hands-on experience with surveillance detection and counter-surveillance techniques through an interactive learning environment that simulates real-world monitoring scenarios.

Demo Components:

Signal Detection Station: Participants use custom-built RF detectors to scan for wireless surveillance devices. Real-time visualizations show the electromagnetic spectrum around them, revealing hidden cameras, microphones, and tracking devices.

Facial Recognition Jamming Lab: Demonstration of infrared LED arrays and computer vision poisoning techniques that can confuse facial recognition systems. Participants can test these tools against live facial recognition software.

Secure Communication Network: A local mesh network that allows anonymous messaging between participants without internet connectivity or corporate mediation. Messages are encrypted and automatically deleted after transmission.

Privacy Toolkit Assembly: Hands-on workshop where participants build their own pocket-sized surveillance detection devices using open-source hardware and learn to configure privacy-protecting software on their personal devices.

Surveillance Theater: Role-playing scenarios where participants take turns being surveillance operators and targets, developing empathy for different positions while learning how monitoring systems actually function.

Digital Security Training: Practical instruction in using VPNs, encrypted messaging, secure browsers, and other privacy tools, with emphasis on threat modeling and assessing personal risk levels.

The demo emphasizes practical skills over theoretical knowledge, ensuring participants leave with actionable tools and techniques they can apply in their daily lives.
