The Cartographies demo features an interactive mapping station where participants can explore existing community justice practices and contribute their own knowledge about alternative legal systems in their communities.

Interactive Elements:
- Digital map interface showing global justice alternatives
- Story collection booth for recording oral histories
- Physical mapping tools for collaborative cartography sessions
- Community protocol design workshops
- Resource library of abolition and transformative justice materials

Participants can navigate through different scales of legal geography, from household conflict resolution to community mediation circles to regional networks of mutual aid. The interface allows filtering by type of practice, cultural context, and scale of implementation.
