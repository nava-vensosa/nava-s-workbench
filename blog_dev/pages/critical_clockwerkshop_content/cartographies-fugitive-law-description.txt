"Cartographies of Fugitive Law" is an interactive mapping project that traces alternative legal systems, unofficial justice practices, and grassroots dispute resolution mechanisms that operate alongside or in resistance to state-sanctioned legal frameworks. The project creates digital and physical maps that document how communities create their own systems of accountability, reparation, and collective care.

Drawing inspiration from abolitionist organizing, Indigenous justice practices, and community mediation traditions, the project visualizes legal pluralism—the reality that multiple legal systems operate simultaneously in any given geographical space. Through collaborative mapping workshops, oral history collection, and speculative design exercises, participants contribute to an ever-expanding atlas of justice alternatives.

The installation includes interactive digital maps that allow users to explore different legal geographies, physical mapping tools for documenting local justice practices, and workshop spaces where communities can design their own dispute resolution protocols. Rather than offering prescriptive solutions, the project creates space for collective imagination about what justice could look like outside of punitive state systems.

The project argues that fugitive law—legal practices that evade state control—already exists everywhere and that mapping these practices can strengthen community capacity for self-governance while inspiring broader transformations in how we approach conflict, harm, and accountability.
