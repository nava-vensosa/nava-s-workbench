"On Cartography: Speculative Figure Drawing as Anarchival Practice" investigates how the act of drawing bodies can serve as a form of counter-mapping that challenges dominant cartographic representations of space, identity, and belonging. The project treats figure drawing not as aesthetic exercise but as anarchival practice—a way of creating alternative records that resist institutional archives and official geographical knowledge.

Through collaborative drawing sessions, participants create speculative maps using human figures as cartographic elements. Bodies become territories, gestures become borders, and relationships become transportation networks in maps that prioritize lived experience over governmental or corporate spatial logic.

The project draws from feminist cartography, queer geography, and anarchival theory to explore how drawing practices can document ways of being and moving that escape official surveillance and categorization. Each drawing session becomes an exercise in collective world-building where participants literally map alternative realities into existence.

The work argues that all cartography is speculative—that maps create the territories they claim to represent—and that figure drawing offers a particularly powerful method for imagining and documenting other worlds where bodies, relationships, and movements are organized according to different principles of justice and care.
