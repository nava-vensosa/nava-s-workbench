Thesis: "Temporal Entanglements: Feminist Archaeologies of Computational Futures"

Astrid/Antikythera challenges linear narratives of technological progress by proposing alternative temporalities where ancient wisdom and future speculation entangle in productive ways. The project argues that dominant histories of computing systematically erase feminine-coded ways of knowing, creating impoverished understandings of both technological capability and human potential.

Central Arguments:

1. Archaeological Speculation as Feminist Method: By creating fictional archaeological evidence, the project demonstrates how speculative methods can reveal the constructed nature of technological narratives and open space for alternative possibilities.

2. Challenging Technological Determinism: Rather than accepting inevitable technological "progress," the project suggests that different cultural values and social organizations would have produced entirely different technological trajectories.

3. Embodied vs. Abstract Knowledge: The project contrasts the embodied, contextual knowledge practices of ancient artisans with the abstract, universal claims of contemporary computing, arguing for more situated approaches to technological development.

4. Temporality and Feminist Futurity: Drawing on feminist science fiction and Afrofuturist theory, the project proposes non-linear temporalities where past, present, and future inform each other in complex ways.

5. Decolonizing Technological Narratives: By highlighting sophisticated ancient technologies, the project challenges Eurocentric narratives that position "primitive" societies as technological precursors rather than sophisticated knowledge systems in their own right.

The project contributes to growing bodies of work in feminist technoscience, decolonial computing, and speculative design, while offering practical methodologies for imagining alternative technological futures rooted in different values and social relations.
