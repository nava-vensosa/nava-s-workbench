Thesis: "Incomplete Capture: Counter-Surveillance as Creative Practice"

"Caught You___" argues that surveillance systems, despite their apparent omnipresence and sophistication, are fundamentally incomplete and that these incompleteness present opportunities for creative resistance and autonomous action. The project challenges both techno-optimist narratives that celebrate surveillance technologies and defeatist positions that assume total monitoring is inevitable.

Central Arguments:

1. Surveillance Incompleteness: All surveillance systems have gaps, glitches, and blind spots that can be identified, documented, and exploited for protective purposes. Perfect surveillance is technically impossible and economically unsustainable.

2. Counter-Surveillance as Creative Practice: Developing tools and techniques for evading surveillance requires the same creative problem-solving skills used in art and design, suggesting productive connections between aesthetic practice and political resistance.

3. Collective Privacy: Individual privacy protection is impossible under current conditions, but collective action can create temporary autonomous zones where surveillance is minimized or impossible.

4. Practical Paranoia: Rather than dismissing privacy concerns as paranoia, the project argues for cultivating appropriate paranoia as a survival skill and creative practice in surveilled societies.

5. Open Source Security: Proprietary security tools recreate the same power imbalances that surveillance systems enforce. Only open source, collectively developed tools can provide genuine security for marginalized communities.

6. Surveillance Literacy: Understanding how surveillance systems work is a prerequisite for effective resistance. Counter-surveillance education should be as fundamental as digital literacy.

The project contributes to critical security studies, tactical media, and design justice by demonstrating how creative practice can generate both practical tools and critical consciousness around surveillance and privacy.
