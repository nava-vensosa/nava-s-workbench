== Week 1
*_10 / 31 / 2025_*

This was my first week at the ITP Coding Lab. As it was Halloween, nobody came -- but Justin was there, and I mostly spoke with him and learned how to punch in, and got a sense of what to expect working at the Coding Lab

== Week 2
*_11 / 7 / 2025_*

This week, Michael booked hours with me, and I helped him with Dynamic Web Development. We went over the first two weeks of content and caught him up in the class, though didn't get to finishing his homework which was to be due on the upcoming Monday. 
#v(1em)
Most of this shift was spent setting up his computer, his remote server, his secure shell access, his github, and making it such that he could use it all without any help. His machine wasn'
t completely up to date, so it took a bit of time. As we went through the setup, we discussed topics from the class, as well as the concepts behind the setup (such as "what is git" or "what is a secure shell" or "how can I use the terminal to navigate my filesystem?")

We worked together for nearly the full 3 hours of my shift.

== Week 3
*_11 / 14 / 2025_*
This week I worked with Michael again. It took the full 3 hours, and we also met for an additional hour that weekend to finish catching him up on the assignments.

We started by designing the webpages and UX pathway he wanted for his website on paper. Then, we translated those sketches into a file structure / codebase. We populated the codebase with the different content from the course files, tailoring it to Michael's design, and we discussed how express apps and .ejs work in opposition to what we had done in the first two weeks of the course.

== Week 4
*_11 / 21 / 2025_*

This week, I worked briefly with Ian, helping out with some game design they were play testing... there wasn't much coding involved, but there was project testing and feedback provided! Then, I spent close to an hour with Shloka, working on the chassis design for her PComp final.

== Week 5
*_11 / 26 / 2025_*

I started off working with Ceren on her final for Applications, going over survey design and skeletoning. Then, William came to me with a project he's working on for PComp and Hypercinema, and I gave a little feedback.

== Week  6
*_12 / 5 / 2025_*

First I took over from Justin working with Yilin on her model training project for one of her finals (I think it was a connected devices or neural systems class or something like that). I walked her through some basics, as she was trying to do something advanced. We set up Git Bash and made it her default terminal, and I taught her the basics of how to use terminal -- how to navigate, how branches work, what serial processing and pointer logic are. Then, as we got into her model training ambitions, I gave her a crash course on vectorized matrix operations and how model trainig / backpropogation work, so she could better understand the Tensorflow/PyTorch outputs she would need to work with. We revised her plan, and created a step-by-step itemized list with copy-pasteable instructions so she could get to a working demo in time for her final. Then, Michael came by, and I helped him fix a couple bugs in his code, and we came up with a step-by-step plan for his Dynamic Web Development final project's implementation needs. Those two took up the full 3 hours!
