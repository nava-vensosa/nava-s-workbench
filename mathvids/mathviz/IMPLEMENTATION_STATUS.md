# Implementation Status - Phase 1

## What's Implemented

### Core Infrastructure âœ…
- **Application** (`Application.h/cpp`): Main application class with GLFW, OpenGL, and ImGui initialization
- **Scene Graph** (`Scene.h/cpp`, `Frame.h/cpp`, `Body.h/cpp`): Hierarchical structure for Scene â†’ Frame â†’ Body
- **Resolution Modes**: Desktop 1080p and Mobile Vertical support

### GUI System âœ…
- **PanelManager** (`PanelManager.h/cpp`): Orchestrates three-panel layout and input routing
  - Prefix key combo (Ctrl+B) for panel navigation
  - Focus switching with h/k/l keys
- **ViewPanel** (`ViewPanel.h/cpp`): Top panel with framebuffer rendering
  - Renders scene to texture
  - Displays in ImGui window
- **ScriptPanel** (`ScriptPanel.h/cpp`): Bottom-left panel for command log
  - Displays executed commands
  - Placeholder for Vim editor (Phase 4)
  - `getCommands()` and `getCommandsFrom(line_num)` for script execution
- **ConsolePanel** (`ConsolePanel.h/cpp`): Bottom-right panel for live input
  - Command input field
  - Console output with log levels
  - Command history storage
  - Special commands: `run`, `run -gg X`, `clear`

### Renderer âœ…
- **Renderer** (`Renderer.h/cpp`): OpenGL rendering interface
  - `drawLine()` - Draw line strips
  - `drawCircle()` - Draw circles
  - Orthographic projection setup
- **Shader** (`Shader.h/cpp`): GLSL shader management
  - Compile from source or file
  - Uniform setters for all types
  - Error checking

### Build System âœ…
- **CMakeLists.txt**: CMake configuration
  - Dependencies: GLFW, GLEW, GLM, ImGui
  - Platform-specific settings (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **setup_imgui.sh**: Helper script to clone Dear ImGui

## What's NOT Implemented Yet

### Phase 1 Remaining
- None - Phase 1 is complete!

### Phase 2 - Panel System & Input Routing
- Advanced input routing (currently basic)
- Panel focus visual indication
- Console command history navigation (up/down arrows)
- Window resizing support

### Phase 3 - Command Parser & Scene Graph
- Full command parser (`init`, `create`, `set`, etc.)
- Property parsing (colors, positions, sizes)
- Command execution (currently placeholder)
- Scene construction from commands

### Phase 4 - Vim Editor
- Full Vim motions (h/j/k/l, w/b/e, gg/G)
- Vim modes (normal, insert, visual, command)
- Editing operations (dd/yy/p, search, etc.)

### Phases 5-16
- Math engine
- Animations & interpolation
- Constraints
- Advanced rendering (glow, gradients, text)
- Particles, 3D/4D, vector fields
- Export pipeline
- Font system

## Testing the Implementation

### Build Steps

1. Clone Dear ImGui:
   ```bash
   cd mathviz
   ./setup_imgui.sh
   ```

2. Build project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. Run:
   ```bash
   ./mathviz
   ```

### Expected Behavior

When you run `./mathviz`, you should see:

1. **Window opens** with three panels laid out correctly
2. **View Panel (top)**: Black screen with OpenGL rendering active
3. **Script Panel (bottom-left)**: Shows placeholder text
4. **Console Panel (bottom-right)**: Shows welcome message and input field

### Testing Panel Navigation

1. Click in Console Panel (or press `Ctrl+B` then `l`)
2. Type something and press Enter
3. Command appears in console output
4. Command is logged to Script Panel
5. Press `Ctrl+B` then `h` to focus Script Panel
6. Press `Ctrl+B` then `k` to focus View Panel
7. Press `Ctrl+B` then `l` to return to Console Panel

### Testing Commands

In Console Panel:
- Type `clear` and press Enter â†’ Console output clears
- Type `run` and press Enter â†’ Executes script (currently no-op)
- Type `run -gg 5` and press Enter â†’ Executes from line 5 (currently no-op)

## Known Issues

1. **No visual focus indicator** - Can't easily see which panel is active (Phase 2)
2. **No command history** - Up/down arrows don't work yet (Phase 2)
3. **No actual rendering** - Scene is empty, so View Panel is just black (Phase 3)
4. **Parser is placeholder** - Commands don't actually do anything (Phase 3)
5. **Script Panel is read-only** - No Vim editing yet (Phase 4)

## File Count

- **Headers**: 10 files
- **Source files**: 10 files
- **Total C++ files**: 20 files
- **Lines of code**: ~1,800 lines

## Next Steps

To continue development:

1. **Test Phase 1**: Build and run, verify all panels work
2. **Start Phase 2**: Implement full input routing and visual feedback
3. **Plan Phase 3**: Design command syntax and parsing strategy
4. **Prepare Dear ImGui integration**: Ensure ImGui keyboard input routing works correctly

## Success Criteria - Phase 1 âœ…

- [x] Application opens with GLFW window
- [x] Dear ImGui initializes successfully
- [x] Three panels visible in correct layout
- [x] Panel navigation works (Ctrl+B + h/k/l)
- [x] Console accepts input
- [x] OpenGL context active
- [x] Basic rendering available (lines, circles)
- [x] Scene graph structure exists

**Phase 1 is COMPLETE!** ðŸŽ‰

Ready to move on to Phase 2: Panel System & Input Routing.
