___
In this directory, I keep a Thought Journal for my distracted thoughts, and I keep a Hupomnemata for quick to-do items.

The Fool's Journey begins with a magic trick. My favorite deck, the Oswald Wirth, translates "The Magician" as "The Juggler." This is one of my favourite cards in the Major Arcana for this parallactic translation-- what looks like magic might just be somebody performing a trick they built skill in over time, and one's talents truly are magical. Magic, technology, techne tou biou... there's a lot to juggle and I'm fluctuating between getting a grip and losing grip. Juggling is an act of Hold & Release-- I should really write an entry about Hold & Release, the show we put on and also the many thoughts in its orbit. These bodies going up and falling down are a rhythm; metronomy is a juggling act, a song and dance.
