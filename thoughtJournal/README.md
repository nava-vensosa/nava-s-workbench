# Thought Journal
---

In this directory, I keep a Thought Journal for my distracted thoughts, and I keep a Hupomnemata for quick to-do items.

The Fool's Journey begins with a magic trick. My favorite deck, the Oswald Wirth, translates "The Magician" as "The Juggler." This is one of my favourite cards in the Major Arcana for this parallactic translation-- what looks like magic might just be somebody performing a trick they built skill in over time, and one's talents truly are magical. Magic, technology, techne tou biou... there's a lot to juggle and I'm fluctuating between getting a grip and losing grip. Juggling is an act of Hold & Release-- I should really write an entry about Hold & Release, the show we put on and also the many thoughts in its orbit. These bodies going up and falling down are a rhythm; metronomy is a juggling act, a song and dance.

The month is nearing an end, autumn's here, and winter is coming soon. Isn't that lovely. 

I've got work to do with: Sasha, Jeremy, Emilia, Gabe, Greg Shakar, Alanna, Michael, Nandi, Ethan, Tom, Will, Schiffman; I've also got to build up my website and mailing list, and email Ru and Chris from Carla's Show. Today, I've also got to do my homework for applications, and edit the video for Hypercinema. It would be good to scrape together a plan for VL as well. I should coordinate with Rachel our submission and documentation for Site Specific Explora. 

Sasha: FIBRIL, and eventually Astrid

Jeremy / Emilia: Orrery; Gabe will help with this too

Alanna: Math Educational Bitsy Games (Consider adding Sana to the group)

Michael: Language Games (literally)

Nandi: Tutoring

Ethan: Groove Pizza... something? Generally getting to know more people at NYU?

Greg Shakar: Quantum Physics and Education? Fred Moten? The Essay?

Tom: I should prep a digest of all this and ask his advice; also he can maybe help with how broke i am, and maybe finding research

Will: Just wanna hang with the dude and see what comes of it, maybe talk technical shit and see what comes up; he might be a good one like Ceren and Aditya for Visuals and Marketing

Shiffman: Broadcasting Club, as well as general advising on my implementation of FIBRIL and the documentation of my works; maybe creating an animation language for videos and making a youtube channel.

Classes:
- Hypercinema: Edit the Video, do some foley if you can, and send it to the team
- Applications: ???
- Visual Language: Put together a game plan for the monograph
- Site Specific Explorations: Work with Rachel to get the documentation together
